It\\'s what\\r\\nkeeps everything from happening at once.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>A ripple of laughter went about the little group of men.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Quite so,\" agreed the Chemist. \"And, gentlemen, that\\'s not nearly so\\r\\nfunny as it sounds. As a matter of fact, it is really not a bad\\r\\nscientific definition. Time and space are all that separate one event\\r\\nfrom another. Everything happens some<i>where</i> at some<i>time</i>.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You intimated you had something vitally important to tell us,\" the Big\\r\\nBusiness Man suggested. \"Something, Rogers, that would amaze us. Some\\r\\nproject you were about to undertake—\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Rogers raised his hand. \"In a moment, gentlemen. I want to prepare you\\r\\nfirst—to some extent, at least. That\\'s why I have led you into this\\r\\ndiscussion. I want you to realize that your preconceived ideas of time\\r\\nare wrong, inadequate. You must think along entirely different lines, in\\r\\nterms of, I shall say, the <i>new science</i>.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I will,\" agreed George, \"only tell me how.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You said that time, space, and matter are not separate, distinct\\r\\nentities, but are blended together,\" the Doctor declared. \"Just what do\\r\\nyou mean?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Rogers gazed earnestly about the room. \"This, my friends. Those are the\\r\\nthree factors which make up our universe as we know it. I said they were\\r\\nblended. I mean that the actual reality underlying all the\\r\\nmanifestations we experience is not temporal or spatial or material, but\\r\\na blend of all three. It is we who, in our minds, have split up the\\r\\n<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_6\">[Pg 6]</a></span>original unity into three such supposedly different things as time,\\r\\nspace and matter.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Take space and time,\" said the Big Business Man. \"Those two seem wholly\\r\\ndifferent to me. I shouldn\\'t think they had the slightest connection.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"But they have. Between the three planes of space—length, breadth and\\r\\nthickness—and time, there is no essential distinction. We think of them\\r\\ndifferently; we instinctively feel differently about them. But science\\r\\nis not concerned with our feelings—and science recognizes today that\\r\\ntime is a property of space, just as are length, breadth and thickness.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"That\\'s easy to say,\" growled the Banker. \"Any one can make statements\\r\\nthat can\\'t be proven.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"It has been proven,\" Rogers declared quietly. \"The mathematical\\r\\nlanguage of science would bore you. Let me give you a popular\\r\\nillustration—an illustration, by the way, that I saw in print long\\r\\nbefore Einstein\\'s theory was made public. For instance, think about\\r\\nthis: A house has length, breadth and thickness. The house is matter,\\r\\nand it has three dimensions of space. But what else has it?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>A blank silence followed his sudden question.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Hasn\\'t it duration, gentlemen? Could a house have any real existence if\\r\\nit did not exist for any time at all?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Well,\" said George, \"I guess that\\'s something to think about.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Rogers went on calmly: \"You must admit, my friends, that the existence\\r\\nof matter depends on time equally as on space. They are, as I said,\\r\\nblended together. A house must have length, breadth, thickness and\\r\\nduration, or it cannot exist. Matter, in other words, persists in time\\r\\nand space. Let me give you another illustration of this blending. How\\r\\nwould you define motion?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Again there was a dubious silence.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Motion,\" said George suddenly, \"why, that\\'s when something—something\\r\\nmaterial changes place.\" He was blushing at his own temerity, and he sat\\r\\nback in his leather chair, smoking furiously.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_7\">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>\"Quite so,\" smiled Rogers. \"That, gentlemen, is about the way we all\\r\\nconceive motion. Something material, a railroad train, for instance,\\r\\nchanges its position in space.\" He regarded the men before him, and this\\r\\ntime there was a touch of triumph in his manner. \"But, my friends,\\r\\nthat\\'s where our line of reasoning is inadequate. Time is involved\\r\\nequally with space. The train was there <i>then</i>; it is here <i>now</i>. That\\r\\ninvolves time.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"In other words—\" the Doctor began.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"In other words, motion is the simultaneous change of the position of\\r\\nmatter in time and space. You see how impossible it is to speak of one\\r\\nfactor without involving the others? That is the mental attitude into\\r\\nwhich I\\'m trying to get you. I want you to think of time exactly as you\\r\\nthink of length, breadth and thickness—as one of the properties of\\r\\nspace. Isn\\'t that clear?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The Big Business Man answered him. \"I think so. I can understand now\\r\\nwhat you mean by a blending of—\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Oh, his words are clear enough,\" the Banker interjected testily. \"But\\r\\nwhat\\'s the argument about? He started in by saying—\"</p>\\r\\n<p>George sat up suddenly. \"Mr. Rogers, you said we were to come here for\\r\\nsomething vitally important to you. Something about time and space. You\\r\\nsaid—\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Rogers interrupted him. \"I did indeed. I asked you all to come here to\\r\\nthe club tonight because you are my friends. Mine and Loto\\'s. And the\\r\\naffair concerns him more directly than it does me.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He glanced across the room. \"Come, Loto. You\\'re the one to tell them.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The Chemist\\'s son, a young man of twenty, rose reluctantly from his\\r\\nobscure seat in a corner of the room. He was tall, and slight of build,\\r\\nwith thick, wavy chestnut hair and blue eyes; his delicate features were\\r\\noffset by a square firmness of chin. He came forward slowly, flushing as\\r\\nthe eyes of the men were turned on him; a poetic-looking boy, with only\\r\\nthe firm line of his lips and the set of his jaw to mark him for a man.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_8\">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>\"My son, gentlemen,\" Rogers added. \"You all know Loto.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"We do,\" said George enthusiastically. He vacated his own chair, shoving\\r\\nit forward, and selected another, more retired position for himself.</p>\\r\\n<p>Loto settled himself in the chair and then hesitated, as though in doubt\\r\\nhow to begin. He was still flushing, and yet his manner was thoroughly\\r\\npoised. His forehead was wrinkled in thought.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Father and I were experimenting,\" he began abruptly, \"about two years\\r\\nago. We were interested in electrons. We were experimenting with the\\r\\nfluorescence in a Crookes tube—breaking down the atoms into electrons.\\r\\nThen we followed the experiments of Lenard and Roentgen. We darkened the\\r\\ntube and prepared a chemical screen, which grew luminous.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Loto turned to Rogers: \"They don\\'t want to hear all this. These\\r\\ntechnicalities—\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Rogers smiled. \"We hit upon it quite by accident—an accident that we\\r\\nhave never been able to duplicate. We had, that evening, an adaptation\\r\\nof the familiar Crookes tube. I do not know the exact conditions we\\r\\nsecured; we had no idea we were on the threshold of any discovery and we\\r\\nkept no record of what we did. Nor am I sure just how I prepared the\\r\\nscreen—what proportions of the chemicals I used—\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You\\'re worse than Loto,\" the Banker growled. \"If you\\'ll just tell us\\r\\nwhat—\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I will,\" agreed Rogers good-naturedly. \"We were working one night in my\\r\\nlaboratory on Forty-third Street—only a few hundred yards from the\\r\\nScientific Club here. The room was dark, and we had set up a small\\r\\nchemical screen. It grew luminous as the electrons from the tube struck\\r\\nit, but the glowing was not what we had expected—not what we had\\r\\nobserved before. The difference is unexplainable to you, but we both\\r\\nnoticed it. And then Loto noticed something else, something in the\\r\\ndarkness behind the screen.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Loto was sitting upright on the edge of his chair; his<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_9\">[Pg 9]</a></span> eyes were\\r\\nsnapping with eagerness as he interrupted his father.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I\\'ll tell them because it was I who saw it first. Behind the screen,\\r\\nthe darkness of the room itself was growing luminous with a glowing\\r\\nradiance that seemed to spread out into rays that were not parallel, but\\r\\ndivergent. It looked almost as though the screen were a searchlight\\r\\nsending a spreading beam out behind it.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Father saw it almost as soon as I did. It was a very curious light; it\\r\\ndid not illuminate the room about us. Then we suddenly discovered that\\r\\nit went through the walls of the laboratory. We were looking into a\\r\\nspace that seemed to be opening up for miles ahead of us. The walls of\\r\\nthe room, the house itself, the city around us, were all blotted out. We\\r\\nwere looking into an empty distance.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Empty?\" echoed George tensely. \"Didn\\'t you see anything?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Not at first.\" Loto had relaxed; his earnest gaze passed from one to\\r\\nthe other of the intent faces of the men. \"We were only conscious of\\r\\nempty distance. It was not darkness nor was it light. It was more a dim\\r\\nphosphorescence. We had forgotten the Crookes tube, the screen,\\r\\neverything but that glowing, empty scene before us.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"After a moment, or it may have been much longer, the scene seemed to\\r\\nbrighten. It turned to gleaming silver, and then we saw that we were\\r\\nlooking out over a snow-covered waste. Miles of it. Snow reaching back\\r\\nto the horizon, and dull gray sky overhead. The ground seemed about\\r\\nsixty feet below us, and we were poised in the air above it.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Loto paused a moment, and Rogers added, \"You understand, gentlemen, that\\r\\nmy laboratory is not on the ground floor of the building, but somewhat\\r\\nabove the level of that part of the city.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"But—\" began the Big Business Man.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Let him go on,\" growled the Banker. \"Go on, boy. Didn\\'t you see\\r\\nanything but snow?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"No, not at once. It was all bleak and desolate. But it kept on\\r\\nbrightening, losing its silvery, glowing look until at<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_10\">[Pg 10]</a></span> last we could\\r\\nsee it was daylight. It was apparently late afternoon—or perhaps early\\r\\nmorning. The sun wasn\\'t showing—it must have been behind a cloud.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"We sat staring down at this cold, snowy landscape, and then, almost\\r\\nfrom below us, something moving came into view. It had passed under\\r\\nus—under the laboratory—and was traveling on away from us.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"What was it?\" the Banker demanded.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Well, it seemed to be a huge sled, with fur covered figures on it, and\\r\\npulled by an animal almost as large as a horse. But it wasn\\'t a\\r\\nhorse—it was a dog.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Loto paused, but no one else spoke. After a moment he resumed:</p>\\r\\n<p>\"The sled slackened and stopped about a quarter of a mile north of the\\r\\nlaboratory—up toward where Central Park is now. And then we saw that\\r\\nthere was a building there, a large, oval-shaped structure. It may have\\r\\nbeen built of snow, or ice—or perhaps some whitish stone. There seemed\\r\\nto be an enclosed space behind it. The whole thing blended into the\\r\\nlandscape so that we had overlooked it before.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"The sled stopped. We could see the figures climbing down from it. Then\\r\\nthere was sudden darkness. The scene went black. We were sitting facing\\r\\nthe side wall of the laboratory.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"A wire in our apparatus had burned out,\" Rogers explained. \"And that\\r\\nnight I was taken sick. It developed into pneumonia and I was laid up\\r\\nfor weeks. Loto was left alone to follow up our discovery.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Just a minute,\" the Banker interjected. \"Do I understand you to imply\\r\\nthat you actually saw all this? It was not a vision, or an electrical\\r\\npicture of some sort that you were reproducing?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"No, they mean it was an actual scene,\" the Big Business Man put in.\\r\\n\"They were seeing New York City at some other time. Isn\\'t that so?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Rogers nodded. \"Exactly. And while I was sick, Loto went ahead and—\"<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_11\">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>\"Was it the past?\" the Doctor interposed. \"Were you looking back into\\r\\nthe past?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"We were looking across countless centuries into the future,\" said Loto.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"The future!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes,\" declared Rogers. \"Must you always think of the future as a\\r\\nwonderful civilization of marvelous inventions, mammoth buildings and\\r\\nairplanes like ocean steamships? All that lies ahead of us, no doubt. A\\r\\nhundred years—two hundred—a thousand—will bring all that. But further\\r\\non? What about then, gentlemen? Ten thousand years from now? Or fifty\\r\\nthousand? Do you anticipate that civilization will always climb steadily\\r\\nupward? You are wrong. There must be a peak, and then a down grade—the\\r\\ndecadence of mankind.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Please, let me go on,\" Loto said eagerly. \"I need not tell you all now\\r\\nexactly how we knew we were looking into the future, and not the past.\\r\\nWe, ourselves, did not know it that first evening. But later, when I\\r\\nstudied the scene more closely, I could tell easily.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"How?\" the Banker demanded.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"By the details I saw. The type of building. That animal that looked\\r\\nlike a dog. The sun—I\\'ll tell you about that in a moment. An artificial\\r\\nlight in the house—I saw it once or twice when it was night there. And\\r\\nthe girl. Her manner of dress—\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"There was a girl?\" said George quickly. \"A girl! Tell us about her,\\r\\nLoto. Was she pretty? Was she—\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Go on, boy,\" growled the Banker. \"Tell it from where you left off.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes, she was very pretty,\" said Loto gravely. \"She—\" He stopped\\r\\nsuddenly, his gaze drifting off into distance.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Oh boy!\" breathed George, but at the Banker\\'s glare he sat back,\\r\\nabashed.</p>\\r\\n<p>Loto went on after a moment: \"I won\\'t go into details now. While my\\r\\nfather was sick, I was able to examine the scene many times. I even\\r\\nthink I—well, I sat watching it most of the time for a week at least.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_12\">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>\"The house had a sort of stable—or a kennel, if you want to call it\\r\\nthat—behind it. And there was an open space, like a garden, with a wall\\r\\naround it. There was a little tree in the garden; a tree all covered\\r\\nwith snow. But after a few days the sun came out and melted the snow on\\r\\nthe tree branches.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"The girl was a captive. I guess they were bringing her in on that sled\\r\\nthe night we first saw them. There was another woman about the place,\\r\\nand an old man. And a younger man—the one who was holding the girl a\\r\\nprisoner.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You said the house looked about a quarter of a mile away,\" the Banker\\r\\ndeclared. \"How could you see all these details?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I had a small telescope, sir.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"The scene actually was there,\" Rogers put in. \"Loto used a telescope\\r\\nquite as he would have used one through the window to see Central Park.\\r\\nGo on, Loto.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"The girl...\" George prompted.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"She was a small girl. Very slender—about sixteen, I guess. She had\\r\\nlong, golden hair, but it was red when she stood outside with the sun on\\r\\nit. That\\'s because the sun was red; an enormous glowing red ball, like\\r\\nthe end of a cigar. It tinged the snow with blood, but there didn\\'t seem\\r\\nto be much heat from it.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Sometimes I could see the girl through the doorway. There was a door,\\r\\nbut it was transparent—glass, perhaps—and the house was lighted\\r\\ninside. She would sit on a low seat, with her hair in sort of braids\\r\\ndown over her shoulders. Once she played on some little stringed\\r\\ninstrument. And sang. I could see her so plainly it seemed curious not\\r\\nto hear her voice.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"They appeared to treat her kindly, even though she was a captive. But\\r\\nonce the man came in and tried to kiss her. She fended him off. Then he\\r\\nwent out and got on his sled and drove away. He was gone several hours.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"The girl cried that night. She cried for a long time. Once she ran\\r\\noutside, but one of those huge dogs came leaping out of the other\\r\\nbuilding and drove her back. The<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_13\">[Pg 13]</a></span> dog\\'s baying must have aroused the\\r\\nplace. The old man and the woman appeared, and they locked the girl up\\r\\nin some other room. I never saw her again.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"A week or two went by and father was better. But the next time I went\\r\\nto the laboratory, the apparatus wouldn\\'t work. Perhaps the chemicals on\\r\\nthe screen were worn out—We\\'re not really sure. But we\\'ve never been\\r\\nable since to make a screen that would do more than glow. We\\'ve never\\r\\nhad another that would affect the time-space behind it.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You mean,\" said the Big Business Man softly, \"that after those brief\\r\\nglimpses into the future, it is closed again to you?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Rogers spoke. \"Tell them the rest, Loto.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The younger man was hesitant. \"Perhaps you gentlemen wouldn\\'t\\r\\nunderstand. We have seen nothing more, but I couldn\\'t forget that girl.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"<i>I</i> understand,\" George murmured. But Loto went on unheeding:</p>\\r\\n<p>\"It wasn\\'t the scientific part of our discovery that impressed me most.\\r\\nWe kept that secret because we had no proof of what we had done, and we\\r\\ncouldn\\'t seem to get any. It was the girl that bothered me. That girl—a\\r\\ncaptive—facing some danger.... You gentlemen will say she isn\\'t living,\\r\\nthat she won\\'t be alive for thousands of years yet. But <i>I</i> say your\\r\\nconception of it is wrong.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Loto\\'s voice had gained sudden power. He seemed abruptly years\\r\\nolder—forceful, commanding.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"<i>You</i> say that girl <i>will</i> be living in the future. I say she <i>is</i>\\r\\nliving in the future. She is living just as you and I are living—right\\r\\nhere in this exact space that we call New York—within a few hundred\\r\\nyards of this room. She is separated from us, not by space, but only by\\r\\ntime.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You, gentlemen, perhaps cannot conceive of crossing that time. But if\\r\\nit were a mile of space, or a thousand miles, you could imagine crossing\\r\\nit very easily. Yet we know that time is a property of space; not one\\r\\niota different from length, breadth and thickness except that we think\\r\\nof it differently.\"<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_14\">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>Loto\\'s flashing eyes held his little audience. \"Gentlemen, suppose\\r\\nyou—with your human intelligence—were trees, rooted to one spot here\\r\\nin America. And suppose that the accustomed order of things was that\\r\\nAsia would come slowly and steadily toward you and pass before you. That\\r\\nis what time does for us. Do you suppose, under those circumstances,\\r\\nthat you could readily conceive of going across space and reaching Asia?\\r\\nThink about that, gentlemen! It\\'s easy for us to imagine moving through\\r\\nspace, because we\\'ve always done it. But a tree with your intelligence\\r\\nwould not feel that way about it. The tree would say: \\'Asia will be\\r\\nhere.\\' And if you said: \\'That\\'s true. But Asia exists just the same in a\\r\\ndifferent part of space from you. If you go there, you will not have to\\r\\nwait for it to come to you,\\' the tree—even if it had your present\\r\\nintelligence in every other way—wouldn\\'t understand that. Simply\\r\\nbecause the tree had always conceived space as we are accustomed to\\r\\nconceiving time. That conception of ours does not fit the real facts,\\r\\nfor—except for the way space and time affect us personally—there is\\r\\nactually no distinction to be made between them. That is no original\\r\\ntheory of mine; it is modern scientific thought—mathematically proven\\r\\nand accepted ever since Albert Einstein first made his theory public.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>A silence followed Loto\\'s outburst. Rogers broke it:</p>\\r\\n<p>\"We would like to have you gentlemen meet us here two weeks from\\r\\ntonight. We are not quite ready yet. Will you do that?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Every one in the room signified assent.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"But what for?\" George asked earnestly. \"Of course we will, but has Loto\\r\\ndiscovered anything? Has he—\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Loto interrupted him. \"I have been working and experimenting for two\\r\\nyears.\" He had fallen back to his quiet manner. \"Father has helped me,\\r\\nof course. And given me money—more than he could afford.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He smiled at Rogers, who returned it with a gaze of affection.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"In two weeks I will be completely ready. Don\\'t you think so, father?\"<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_15\">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes,\" said Rogers, and a sudden cloud of anxiety crossed his face. He\\r\\nwas a scientist, but he was a father as well, and even his scientific\\r\\nenthusiasm could not allay the fear for his son that was in his heart.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes,\" he repeated. \"I think you will be quite ready, Loto.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Ready for what?\" growled the Banker. He was mopping his forehead with a\\r\\nhuge white handkerchief.</p>\\r\\n<p>Loto\\'s glance swept across all the men in the room. \"I have found a way\\r\\nto cross time, just as you are able to cross space. And two weeks from\\r\\ntonight, gentlemen, with, your assistance, I propose to start forward\\r\\nthrough the centuries that lie ahead of us. I\\'m going to find that\\r\\ngirl—if I can—and release her—help her out of whatever danger,\\r\\nwhatever trouble she is in!\"</p>\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 65%;\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER TWO</h2>\\r\\n<p>\"Honor to Loto,\" cried the Big Business Man. \"The youngest and greatest\\r\\nscientist of all time!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"There\\'s a double meaning in that,\" laughed the Doctor, amid the\\r\\napplause. \"The greatest scientist of time! He is, indeed.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>It was outwardly a gay little gathering, having dinner in a small\\r\\nprivate room of the Scientific Club. But underneath the laughter there\\r\\nwas a note of tenseness, and two of the people—a man and a\\r\\nwoman—laughed infrequently with gayety that was forced.</p>\\r\\n<p>The man was Rogers; the woman, Lylda, his wife, mother of Loto. She was\\r\\nthe only woman in the room. At first glance she would have seemed no\\r\\nmore than thirty-five,<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_16\">[Pg 16]</a></span> though in reality she was several years older—a\\r\\nsmall, slender figure in a simple black evening dress that covered her\\r\\nshoulders, but left her throat bare. Her beauty was of a curious type;\\r\\nher face was oval, her features delicately molded and of pronounced\\r\\nGrecian cast. Yet there seemed about her, also, an indefinable touch of\\r\\nthe Orient; her eyes, perhaps, which were slate gray, large and very\\r\\nslightly upturned at the corners. Her complexion was fair; her hair\\r\\nthick, wavy and coal-black.</p>\\r\\n<p>That she was a woman of intellect, culture and refinement was obvious.\\r\\nThere was about her, too, a look of gentle sweetness, the air of a woman\\r\\nwho could be nothing less than charming. Her eyes, as she met those of\\r\\nher men friends around her, were direct and honest. But when she\\r\\nregarded Loto this evening, a yearning melancholy sprang into them, with\\r\\na mistiness as though the tears were restrained only by an effort.</p>\\r\\n<p>The laughter about the table died out. A waiter was removing the last of\\r\\nthe dishes; the men were lighting their cigars.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Well,\" said the Banker, breaking the silence, \"now let us hear it. If\\r\\neveryone is as curious as I am—\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"More,\" put in George. \"I\\'m more curious.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You\\'re right,\" agreed Rogers. \"We must get on.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"First,\" the Big Business Man interrupted, \"I want to know more about\\r\\nthat screen behind which you saw that other time world of the future.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I know very little myself,\" Rogers answered. \"So little that Loto and I\\r\\ncould never duplicate it. But the theory is understandable. The space\\r\\nwhere Central Park now is has a certain time factor allied to its other\\r\\nproperties. The light, the rays, from that screen, whatever may have\\r\\nbeen their character, altered the time factor of that space.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"As Loto told you, the modern conception of the reality of things is\\r\\nthat the future exists—but with a different time dimension. We have a\\r\\nfamiliar axiom, \\'No two masses of matter can occupy the same space <i>at\\r\\nthe same time</i>.\\' That is just another way of saying it. To reason\\r\\nlogically from<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_17\">[Pg 17]</a></span> that, an infinite number of masses of matter can, and\\r\\ndo, occupy the same space <i>at different times</i>.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I\\'d rather hear about this new experiment,\" the Banker said. \"You made\\r\\nthe statement—\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"So would I,\" agreed George. \"That girl—\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You shall,\" said Rogers. His grave, troubled glance went to his wife\\'s\\r\\nface, but she smiled at him bravely. \"You shall have all the facts as\\r\\nbriefly as I can give them to you.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Loto became obsessed—I can hardly call it anything less—with the idea\\r\\nthat he could alter the time factor of human consciousness. In theory it\\r\\nwas perfectly possible—I had to admit that. And so I let him go ahead.\\r\\nHe has worked feverishly, with an energy I feared would injure his\\r\\nhealth, for nearly two years. But, gentlemen, this is all that counts:\\r\\nhe has succeeded. I\\'m sure of that; we have already made a test. The\\r\\napparatus is ready upstairs now, and—\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Let Loto tell it,\" grumbled the Banker. \"Go on, boy, can\\'t you tell us\\r\\nhow you did it?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes, sir. I can in principle.\" Loto hesitated, then added with a\\r\\nmixture of sarcasm and deference: \"I can explain it to you in a general\\r\\nway, but the details are very technical.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He paused until the waiter had left the room; then he began speaking\\r\\nslowly, evidently choosing his words with the utmost care.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Matter, as we know it now, has four dimensions; the three so-called\\r\\nplanes of space, and one of time. But what is matter? The new science\\r\\ntells us it is molecules, composed of atoms. And atoms? An atom is a\\r\\nring of electrons, which are particles of negative, disembodied\\r\\nelectricity, revolving at enormously high speeds around a central\\r\\nnucleus. Am I clear?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Loto\\'s gaze rested on the Banker, who nodded somewhat dubiously.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Then,\" Loto went on, \"we have resolved all matter to one common entity,\\r\\nthat central nucleus of positive electricity which is sometimes called\\r\\nthe proton. All this is now generally known and accepted. But of what\\r\\nsubstance, what<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_18\">[Pg 18]</a></span> character, is the proton? For years now, the theory has\\r\\nbeen fairly accepted that the proton is merely a vortex, or whirlpool.\\r\\nAnd the electron is conceived to be something very similar. Do you grasp\\r\\nthe significance of that? It robs matter of what I, personally, always\\r\\ninstinctively feel is its chief characteristic—substance. We delve into\\r\\nmatter, resolving its complexities to find one basic substance, and we\\r\\nfind not substance but a whirlpool—electrical, doubtless—in space!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"That makes you rather gasp!\" the Big Business Man exclaimed, gazing\\r\\nabout the table.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"It is quite correct,\" affirmed Rogers. \"It transforms our conception of\\r\\nsubstance to motion. Of what? Motion of something intangible—the ether,\\r\\nlet us say. Or space itself.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I can\\'t seem to get a mental grip on it,\" the Big Business Man\\r\\ndeclared. \"You—\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Think of it this way,\" Rogers went on earnestly. \"Motion can easily\\r\\nchange our impression of solidity. This is not an analogous case,\\r\\nperhaps, but it will give you something to think about. Water is\\r\\nnormally a fluid. You can pass your hand through a stream of water from\\r\\na garden hose. But set that water in more rapid motion, and what\\r\\nphysical impression do you get? At Fully, Switzerland, water for a\\r\\nturbine emerges from a nozzle at a speed of four hundred miles per hour.\\r\\nWhat would happen if you tried to pass your hand through that? I have\\r\\nseen a jet no more than three inches in diameter of such rapidly moving\\r\\nwater, and you cannot cut through it with the blow of a crowbar! There\\r\\nyou have a physical substance—an impression of solidity—derived from\\r\\nmotion.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"But what has all this to do with time?\" the Banker objected, after a\\r\\nmoment of silence.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Everything,\" said Loto quickly. \"Since we are changing the\\r\\ntime-dimension of matter, without altering its space-dimensions, you\\r\\nmust have some conception of what matter really is. When once you\\r\\nrealize the real intangibility of<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_19\">[Pg 19]</a></span> even our own bodies, or this house we\\r\\nare in, you will be able to understand us better.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The Banker relaxed. \"Go on, boy. Let\\'s hear it.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes, sir. Changing the time-dimension of substance amounts merely to a\\r\\nchange in the rate and character of the motion that constitutes the\\r\\nelectrical vortex we call a proton.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Loto looked at Rogers somewhat helplessly, with a faintly quizzical\\r\\nsmile twitching at his lips.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I seem to be talking very ponderously tonight, father. I wonder if it\\r\\nwouldn\\'t be easier for us to show them the apparatus?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Rogers rose from his chair. \"By all means. Gentlemen, Loto has completed\\r\\nhis apparatus on the roof of the club. You may have noticed for the past\\r\\nmonth that one end is boarded up, and has a canvas roof over it. That is\\r\\nwhere Loto has been working. Will you come up with us?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The building that houses the New York Scientific Club is a full block in\\r\\ndepth and twenty stories high. Its flat roof is surrounded by a parapet\\r\\nof stone. One end of the roof is a garden, with pergolas, trellised\\r\\nvines, and beds of flowers with white gravel walks between. At the other\\r\\nend, on this particular evening, a twenty-foot, rough board wall\\r\\nenclosed a space about a hundred feet square, with a canvas roof above\\r\\nit.</p>\\r\\n<p>The night was calm and moonless, with a purple sky brilliantly studded\\r\\nwith stars. At this height the hum of the great city was stilled. Near\\r\\nby, many buildings towered still higher, but for the most part the roofs\\r\\nlay below, with their chimneys and pot-bellied water tanks set upon\\r\\nspindly legs like huge, grotesque bugs on guard. A block away the roof\\r\\ngarden of a great hotel blazed with red and green lights. Spots of light\\r\\ncrawled through the streets below, with black blobs that were\\r\\npedestrians scurrying between them. Occasionally the drone of a plane\\r\\noverhead broke the stillness.</p>\\r\\n<p>Rogers led the way across the roof top, and unlocked a tiny door that\\r\\nled into the temporary board enclosure. Lylda<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_20\">[Pg 20]</a></span> and Loto entered last,\\r\\nthe woman clinging to her son\\'s hand. The turn of a switch flooded the\\r\\nplace with light.</p>\\r\\n<p>At first glance one would have said it was a modern passenger airplane\\r\\nthat was standing there under the canvas—a huge, glistening dragonfly\\r\\nof aluminum color with a long, narrow cabin below.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"There,\" said Rogers, \"is the product of Loto\\'s work. What you see from\\r\\nhere is merely an adaptation of the Frazia plane—and the Frazia company\\r\\nbuilt it for us. The apparatus flies as any other Frazia plane does; it\\r\\nhas the same motors, the same equipment. Its other mechanism—by which\\r\\nthe time-dimension, the basic electrical nature of the whole apparatus,\\r\\nand everything or everybody within its cabin can be changed at\\r\\nwill—that mechanism Loto constructed and installed himself.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"There you go again,\" growled the Banker. \"Let Loto tell it, won\\'t you?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Rogers bridled a little. \"I\\'ll tell you this, Donald. That is the\\r\\napparatus in which Loto is going to cross time into the future. At least\\r\\nyou can understand that—if you keep your mind on it.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>There was a general laugh at the Banker\\'s expense. But Lylda did not\\r\\nlaugh. She was leaning against a wooden post, clinging to her son\\'s\\r\\nhand, and staring at that sleek, shining thing with wide, terrified\\r\\neyes.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Come, Loto,\" said Rogers. \"They want you to show it to them.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The young man disengaged himself from his mother and went forward. In a\\r\\nmoment the men were scattered about, examining the plane.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You may not understand the Frazia model,\" Loto was saying. \"It was only\\r\\nput on the market recently. It\\'s slightly larger than the average of the\\r\\nolder types—more stable in the air, but no faster. The \\'copter-type,\\r\\nvariable-pitch propellers are powered by a Frazier atomic motor.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The Banker called to them. He was standing on a box, looking into one of\\r\\nthe cabin windows. \"You\\'ve got different rooms in here.\"<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_21\">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes, sir,\" said Loto. \"I\\'ve divided it into three small compartments\\r\\naccording to my own needs.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Can we get inside?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I think perhaps it would be better not to,\" said Rogers, coming\\r\\nforward. \"At least, not tonight. Loto wants to get started. There is—\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You plan to operate this <i>tonight</i>?\" the Doctor asked.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes,\" answered Loto. \"I am going forward in time, to—\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"To find that girl,\" George finished eagerly. \"To rescue her. Don\\'t you\\r\\nremember he saw her in that—\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Be quiet, boy,\" the Banker commanded. \"Loto, what is this other\\r\\nmechanism your father mentioned?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"It is not particularly complicated,\" the young man answered readily.\\r\\n\"In general principle, that is. The Frazia mechanism causes the machine\\r\\nto travel through space—to change its space-factors at the will of the\\r\\noperator. That\\'s clear, isn\\'t it?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Of course it is,\" said the Banker impatiently.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"It\\'s clear because you\\'ve always been able to travel through space\\r\\nyourself,\" interjected the Big Business Man. \"Don\\'t be so\\r\\nself-satisfied, Donald. If you\\'d been rooted to one spot all your\\r\\nlife—like a tree—you wouldn\\'t have a chance on earth of understanding\\r\\nan airplane.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"That\\'s exactly what I mean,\" said Loto quickly. \"My other mechanism\\r\\nchanges the time-factor of the entire apparatus. I can explain it best\\r\\nthis way: Every particle of matter in that machine—as well as my own\\r\\nbody—is electrical in its basic nature. My mechanism circulates a\\r\\ncurrent through every particle of that matter. Not an electrical\\r\\ncurrent, but something closely allied to it. The nature of this I do not\\r\\nyet know. But it causes the inherent vibratory movements of the protons\\r\\nof matter to change their character. The matter changes its state. It\\r\\nacquires a different time-factor, in other words.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Is this change instantaneous?\" the Doctor asked.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"No, sir. It is progressive. To reach the time-factor of tomorrow night,\\r\\ntake the first few minutes of time as it seems<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_22\">[Pg 22]</a></span> to us to pass. The\\r\\ntime-factor of next week would be reached during the succeeding two or\\r\\nthree minutes.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"In other words, it picks up speed,\" said the Big Business Man.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes. How long the acceleration will last I do not know. I have a series\\r\\nof dials for registering the time-movement. By altering the strength,\\r\\nthe intensity of the current, I can vary the speed, or check it\\r\\nentirely.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"But why have this apparatus in the form of an airplane?\" asked the\\r\\nBanker. \"You\\'re going through time, not space.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Rogers answered: \"In a hundred years from now this building will not be\\r\\nhere. If we were to stop his time-movement at that point, he would drop\\r\\ntwenty stories through space to the ground.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Why, of course!\" exclaimed the Big Business Man. \"But in the air...\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Exactly,\" said Loto. \"I shall not start the propellers until later;\\r\\nuntil I am launched into future time, and need them.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Rogers looked at his watch. \"Have you much to do before you start,\\r\\nLoto?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"No, sir—nothing. I have food and water, clothing, and everything else\\r\\nI need. I filled our list very carefully, and checked over everything\\r\\nthis afternoon. I could have started then; I\\'ve left nothing to do\\r\\ntonight.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Then you might as well get away at once. You\\'ll remember everything\\r\\nI\\'ve told you, Loto? You\\'ll come back here, as quickly as possible? Here\\r\\nto this rooftop?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The strain of anxiety under which Rogers was subconsciously laboring\\r\\ncame out suddenly in his voice. \"You\\'ll be careful, lad?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes, sir, of course. I—well, I might as well say good-by now, Father.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>They shook hands silently, and Rogers abruptly turned away.</p>\\r\\n<p>Loto shook hands with the others.</p>\\r\\n<p>The Banker had withdrawn to the farthest corner of the<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_23\">[Pg 23]</a></span> enclosure, where\\r\\nhe stood regarding the airplane fearfully. Loto walked over to him.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Good-by, boy.\" The Banker\\'s voice was gruff and a trifle unsteady.\\r\\n\"Take it easy. Don\\'t be a reckless fool just because you\\'re young.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I\\'ll be all right, sir.\" Silently they shook hands.</p>\\r\\n<p>Loto met his mother a few paces away. He stood head and shoulders above\\r\\nher, and her arms went around him hungrily as he bent down to kiss her.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You\\'ll come back to me, little son?\" she whispered. \"You\\'ll come back\\r\\nsafely?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes, Mother. Of course.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He met her eyes, with the terror lurking in their gray depths.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Don\\'t look like that, <i>mamita</i>. I\\'ll be all right.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Rogers was calling to them. Loto disengaged himself gently.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Good-by, <i>mamita</i>. I\\'ll be back tomorrow or the next day. Don\\'t\\r\\nworry—it\\'s nothing.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The last preparations took no more than a moment or two. Loto climbed to\\r\\nthe cabin and disappeared within it.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Be sure and take off the canvas roof later tonight,\" he called down to\\r\\nthem. \"And leave it off so I can get back.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes,\" said Rogers, \"we will. And one of us, at least, will be here\\r\\nwatching all the time you\\'re away. Good-by, Loto.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Good-by, Father.\" The cabin door closed upon him.</p>\\r\\n<p>At a distance of twenty feet the men stood in a solemn group, watching.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"What will it look like going?\" George whispered.</p>\\r\\n<p>But no one answered him.</p>\\r\\n<p>Presently a low hum became audible. It grew in intensity, until it\\r\\nsounded like the droning of a thousand winged insects. The airplane\\r\\nrocked gently on its foundation. It was straining, trembling in every\\r\\nfiber.</p>\\r\\n<p>A moment passed. Then the plane began to glow, seemingly phosphorescent\\r\\neven in the light of the electric bulbs on the scaffolding beside it.\\r\\nAnother moment. There was a<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_24\">[Pg 24]</a></span> fleeting impression that the thing was\\r\\ngrowing translucent—transparent—vapory. For one brief instant the\\r\\nvision and sound of it persisted—<i>then it was gone</i>!</p>\\r\\n<p>The men stood facing a silent, empty space, where a few loose boards\\r\\nwere lying, with a discarded hammer, a saw, and a keg of nails.</p>\\r\\n<p>They had forgotten the woman. In an opposite corner of the enclosure\\r\\nLylda was seated alone, crying softly and miserably to herself.</p>\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 45%;\">\\r\\n<p>George sat alone on a little bench in the roof garden of the Scientific\\r\\nClub. On the ground beside him, stretched on a broad leather cushion,\\r\\nRogers lay asleep. It was well after midnight. There was hardly a breath\\r\\nof air stirring, and only a few fleecy clouds to hide the stars. In the\\r\\neast, a flattened moon was rising.</p>\\r\\n<p>George sat with his chin cupped in his hands, staring out over the\\r\\nlights and the roofs of the city. The growing moonlight gleamed on his\\r\\nsoft white shirt and white flannel trousers.</p>\\r\\n<p>Rogers stirred and sat up. \"Are you awake, George?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Go on to sleep. I\\'m good for nearly all night.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>But Rogers rose, stretching. \"What time is it?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Quarter of two. Go on to sleep, I tell you.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I\\'ve had enough.\" The older man sat down on the bench and lighted a\\r\\ncigar. \"You\\'d better take a turn, George. You\\'ll wear yourself out.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I can\\'t. I\\'m too excited. How long has he been gone now?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Rogers calculated. \"About twenty-eight hours.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Do you think he\\'ll get back tonight?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I don\\'t know. Perhaps.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I wonder what he\\'s doing right now,\" George persisted after a silence.</p>\\r\\n<p>Rogers did not answer.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You don\\'t think anything could have happened to him, do you?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"No. I—I hope not.\"<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_25\">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>\"I hope he brings that girl back with him,\" George said after another\\r\\nsilence. \"I certainly would like to meet her.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Rogers plucked a flower from the trellis beside them, breaking it in his\\r\\nfingers idly. \"He may get back tonight. It was our idea that—\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He stopped abruptly, and simultaneously George gripped him by the arm.\\r\\nThey both saw it; a little blob of radiance in the air just beyond the\\r\\nflower trellis; a shining spot small as a puff of tobacco smoke gleaming\\r\\nsilvery in the moonlight.</p>\\r\\n<p>George murmured tensely, \"Over there...something.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>A transparent radiance. But in a moment it was congealing, turning into\\r\\na glistening, solid shape. The faint hum of it sounded as it hung in\\r\\nmid-air by the trellis.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Not the plane,\" George murmured. \"Then what is it?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The humming ceased. They could see the little object clearly now; a\\r\\nmetal cube, each of its faces some twenty inches in diameter. It hung\\r\\nfor another moment, then dropped with a little thump to the rooftop.</p>\\r\\n<p>Both the men were on their feet. Rogers said, \"A message from him. An\\r\\nemergency...\" He picked up the cube.</p>\\r\\n<p>George stared wonderingly. \"You know about this?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"We arranged it—only for an emergency. If he could not come, or felt\\r\\nit unwise, he was to send this. We did not want to worry\\r\\nanyone—particularly his mother—so we didn\\'t mention this\\r\\npossibility.\"</p>\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 45%;\">\\r\\n<p>In a downstairs club room, the men and Lylda were gathered, all of them\\r\\ngazing mute and solemn as Rogers opened the cube. Much of its interior\\r\\nwas filled with the intricate time-mechanisms. To one side a sheaf of\\r\\nmanuscript pages was crowded, closely written with Loto\\'s script.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"His message,\" George murmured. \"I do hope he found the girl, and that\\r\\nthey\\'re all right.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I\\'ll read it to you.\" Rogers\\' fingers were trembling as he drew out the\\r\\npages. He lighted a cigarette, steadied himself. \"The first thing he\\r\\nsays—he\\'s all right—\"<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_26\">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>\"Of course he\\'s all right,\" the Banker growled. \"That boy is\\r\\nresourceful.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"He wants us to know that he\\'s safe and well. It says....\"</p>\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 65%;\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER THREE</h2>\\r\\n<p>First I want you all to know, I\\'m quite safe and well. <i>Mamita</i> dear,\\r\\nplease try not to worry about me. Remember, Father we anticipated I\\r\\nmight decide it best to send you a message. I do hope I have calculated\\r\\nthe space-and time-factors correctly, and that I\\'ve set the mechanisms\\r\\nof the cube so that it will come back to you within a day or two after\\r\\nmy departure. I\\'m assuming that is so.</p>\\r\\n<p>You will understand, of course, that as I have lived time, it has been\\r\\nfar longer than that. Much has happened to me, and I want to tell you\\r\\nnow what I can of it.</p>\\r\\n<p>You recall that night when I left you—to me now it seems so long ago. I\\r\\nremember your solemn faces as I closed the door of the cabin after me. I\\r\\nwas in the forward one of the three compartments—you saw it when you\\r\\ninspected the plane the night I started.</p>\\r\\n<p>In this compartment are the controls for the Frazia motors and the\\r\\nflying controls. The controls of my own mechanism are there also. These\\r\\nare simple; merely a switch to regulate the proton current, as Father\\r\\nand I call it, and a series of small dials for recording the\\r\\ntime-change. These dials are geared, with one for days, another for days\\r\\nin multiples of ten, one for years, and others for years in multiples of\\r\\ntens, hundreds, and thousands.</p>\\r\\n<p>I took my seat behind the Frazia controls. I was not going to use them\\r\\nat once, because there was no immediate<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_27\">[Pg 27]</a></span> need to raise the plane into\\r\\nthe air. But I wanted to be seated; I could not tell what the shock of\\r\\nstarting might be. The dials and switch were on the wall at my right. I\\r\\nmoved the lever of the switch over to the first intensity. There was a\\r\\nlow hum. The floor seemed to rock under me. The humming increased; it\\r\\nroared in my ears. Everything was vibrating with an infinitely tiny,\\r\\ntrembling quiver that penetrated into my body, into my bones, even\\r\\ncoursed through my blood.</p>\\r\\n<p>They were swift sensations, I suppose, lasting no more than a few\\r\\nseconds. I felt, as near as I can explain it, as though some force that\\r\\nholds my own body together, cell by cell, were being tampered with; as\\r\\nif, had the struggle continued, I might be shattered into a myriad of\\r\\ntiny fragments, like a puff of exploded powder.</p>\\r\\n<p>The humming grew still louder, and I remember trying to stand up. A wild\\r\\nimpulse to throw back the switch and stop the thing came to me, but I\\r\\nresisted it. Then I was conscious of a sensation of falling headlong; a\\r\\ndizzy, sickening reeling of the senses, rather than the body.</p>\\r\\n<p>I lost consciousness—for only a moment or two, I think. I was sitting\\r\\nin my seat, uninjured. The humming was still in my ears, insistent. But\\r\\nit was not so loud as I had thought, and after a time I forgot it almost\\r\\nentirely.</p>\\r\\n<p>My first impression now was that everything about me was glowing,\\r\\nradiating a phosphorescent light. I looked down at my knees; my clothes\\r\\nwere glowing. I could no longer distinguish color; my hands and my shoes\\r\\nwere the same—all that same glowing phosphorescence. It gave a sense of\\r\\nunreality to everything. And then I saw that everything <i>was</i> unreal;\\r\\nnothing had any substance. I could distinguish the side of the cabin\\r\\nthrough my hand, and beyond the cabin wall I could see the solidity of\\r\\nthe board enclosure where the plane was resting. It was as though my\\r\\nbody and the cabin interior were shimmering ghosts. But when I gripped\\r\\nmy knee with my hand, I felt solid enough.</p>\\r\\n<p>I have given you details of my sensations as I remember them now, but I\\r\\ndo not suppose that more than a minute<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_28\">[Pg 28]</a></span> or two had elapsed since I had\\r\\nfirst pulled the switch. I glanced at the dial recording the passage of\\r\\ndays but there was no movement.</p>\\r\\n<p>I stood up, conscious of a nausea and a strong feeling of\\r\\nlight-headedness. I peered through one of the side windows. Outside,\\r\\neverything looked at first glance as though I had not yet started. The\\r\\nwalls of the enclosure were clear, solid and as distinct as before. Then\\r\\nI saw George staring directly at me, and I could tell by the expression\\r\\nof his face that he was looking, not at the plane, but at an empty space\\r\\nwhere the plane had been.</p>\\r\\n<p>It was all as real outside as though I had been part of it myself—until\\r\\nI saw the others move across the enclosure. They were walking extremely\\r\\nfast and their gestures were rapid; two or three times more rapid than\\r\\nnormal.</p>\\r\\n<p>For what seemed like five or ten minutes I stood there watching you all.\\r\\nIt was like a moving picture being run too fast—and being constantly\\r\\naccelerated. I saw you roll back the canvas roof, and then you went\\r\\nscurrying out through the door—the last of you so fast that the figure\\r\\nblurred in my sight.</p>\\r\\n<p>I was left alone. For a while I sat there, a little dazed. There is a\\r\\nsmall clock on the side wall of the cabin. It might have been completely\\r\\nradium-painted, by the look of it at that moment, but even though it\\r\\nglowed as intangible as a ghost, I could make out the hands. I was sure\\r\\nthey would be traveling through space at their accustomed speed and thus\\r\\ngive me the time of the world I had left. I had started at about ten\\r\\nminutes of ten; the clock now showed about five minutes after ten. I had\\r\\nbeen gone fifteen minutes. Above the enclosure, to the east, I saw the\\r\\nmoon. It was about an hour up, I judged. And that gave me a basis to\\r\\ncompute my starting acceleration. The moon an hour up would have made\\r\\nyour time ten minutes of two—four hours after I started. I had passed\\r\\nthrough those first four hours in fifteen minutes!</p>\\r\\n<p>This was with my control at the weakest intensity of the current. There\\r\\nare twenty subdivisions of power. I pushed<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_29\">[Pg 29]</a></span> the handle around from one\\r\\nto the other of them quickly, pausing only an instant on each, and\\r\\nstopping at the tenth. There was no change of sensation, except that the\\r\\nhumming seemed to grow, not louder exactly, but more powerful—more\\r\\npenetrating. The interior of the cabin and my own body lost visible\\r\\ndensity in appearance. You had switched off the electric lights outside,\\r\\nbut in the moonlight I could still see the board walls, not only through\\r\\nthe windows, but through the metallic sides of the cabin.</p>\\r\\n<p>I was tingling all over, but the sensation, now that I was used to it,\\r\\nwas pleasant rather than the reverse; a feeling of lightness, buoyancy\\r\\nand strength.</p>\\r\\n<p>With the power increased tenfold, the acceleration of time-movement was\\r\\nenormous. The movement of the rising moon became visible; the heavens\\r\\nwere turning over, the stars progressing from point to point with ever\\r\\nincreasing speed.</p>\\r\\n<p>About ten minutes after ten by the clock, the moon was near the zenith,\\r\\nand the sun rose an instant later. I was conscious of a flash of\\r\\ntwilight, and the sun\\'s disk shot up from the horizon. The world was\\r\\nplunged into daylight.</p>\\r\\n<p>From my position inside the enclosure I could see nothing outside but\\r\\nthe sky and one or two of the tallest buildings near at hand. There was\\r\\nno visible movement of anything but the sun. You can understand that, of\\r\\ncourse. Had any of you come into the enclosure, or had an airplane\\r\\npassed overhead, I would not have seen either one. The movement would\\r\\nhave been too rapid for my vision.</p>\\r\\n<p>In perhaps a minute or two the sun was directly overhead, and in another\\r\\nfraction of a minute it had set. Darkness was upon me. Then the moon\\r\\nrose again and flashed across the heavens. Clouds formed and disappeared\\r\\nso quickly I could hardly see them.</p>\\r\\n<p>I glanced at the dial recording days. Its hand was moving. One day had\\r\\npassed, and the hand was traveling toward the next.</p>\\r\\n<p>For ten minutes or so I sat there, while day succeeded night and night\\r\\ncame again, only to be followed almost in<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_30\">[Pg 30]</a></span>stantly by the day light. Soon\\r\\nI could distinguish only thin streaks of light as the sun and moon\\r\\ncrossed above me—streaks that came closer together, merged into one,\\r\\nand separated again as the month passed. And then the days became so\\r\\nbrief that they blurred with the nights. A grayness settled upon\\r\\neverything; the mingled twilight of light and darkness.</p>\\r\\n<p>The hand of the day dial was sweeping around swiftly. I looked at the\\r\\ndial beside it, which recorded days in multiples of ten. Its pointer was\\r\\nalso moving. Forty odd days were recorded and the movement was\\r\\naccelerating every instant.</p>\\r\\n<p>I thought then I had better leave the rooftop. I started the Frazia\\r\\n\\'copters, and rose about a thousand feet. Then I slowed them down until\\r\\na balance with gravity was maintained, and I hung stationary. You may be\\r\\nsurprised that the flying mechanism was effective while I was sweeping\\r\\nso swiftly through time. If our atmosphere did not persist in time, the\\r\\npropellers would have exerted no pressure against it. But the air does\\r\\npersist, and so does gravity.</p>\\r\\n<p>There was apparently no wind. The transient winds and storms of a few\\r\\nhours were all blended. The result, however, must have been a slight\\r\\ninfluence to the north, for I found myself drifting very slowly in that\\r\\ndirection. After a few moments my time-velocity had so increased that\\r\\neven that drift was averaged. I hung motionless.</p>\\r\\n<p>From this height—a thousand feet above the southern boundary of Central\\r\\nPark—the scene below me was a strange one. At first glance, I might\\r\\nhave been hanging in a balloon on a dull, soundless day very heavily\\r\\novercast. Except that the sky, instead of showing dark clouds, was a\\r\\nqueer, luminous gray blur that distinguished nothing.</p>\\r\\n<p>The city below me lay clear cut but absolutely shadowless, which gave it\\r\\na very extraordinary look of flatness—a vista of buildings painted upon\\r\\na huge, concave canvas. Colors were distinguishable, but they were\\r\\nabnormally grayish and drab. Vague, unreal pencil points of light dotted\\r\\nthe scene—electric lights that were on every night in the same<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_31\">[Pg 31]</a></span> spots,\\r\\nand off in the daytime—the blended effect of which was visible. There\\r\\nwas no sound. Nor was there motion. It looked like a dead, empty city.\\r\\nThe streets seemed deserted, with not even a blur to mark those millions\\r\\nof transitory movements of humans and vehicles that I knew were taking\\r\\nplace.</p>\\r\\n<p>I had been conscious of a brief period of chill, and for a moment or two\\r\\nthe scene had assumed a whiter aspect, especially in the park. I\\r\\nconceived this as a blending of several heavy, lingering snowfalls of\\r\\nthe winter.</p>\\r\\n<p>The lowest dial, marking days, now showed only a blur as its pointer\\r\\nswept around. And the year-dial pointer was visibly moving. I had passed\\r\\none year and was well into the second. The clock showed ten thirty. I\\r\\nhad been gone forty minutes!</p>\\r\\n<p>I said there was no visible movement in the scene beneath me. That was\\r\\nso, at first, but I soon began to see plenty of movement. The white look\\r\\nhad come and gone again—far briefer this time—when my attention was\\r\\ncaught by a building on Broadway, along in the Fifties somewhere. It was\\r\\na broad but low building, no more than eight or ten stories high; the\\r\\nlowest in its immediate vicinity. It seemed now to be melting before my\\r\\neyes! That is the only way I can describe it—melting. Parts of it were\\r\\nvanishing! It was dismembering, as though piece by piece it was being\\r\\ntaken apart and carried away. Which, of course, is exactly what was\\r\\nhappening.</p>\\r\\n<p>Can you form a mental picture of that? I hope so, for it was\\r\\ncharacteristic of all the movement that now began to assume visibility\\r\\nthroughout the silent city. This building that melted—I come back to\\r\\nthat word because it seems the only one suitable—was gone in a moment\\r\\nor two. Try to conceive that I did not see actual movement—not the\\r\\nphysical movement we are accustomed to. They were tearing down that\\r\\nbuilding—doubtless over a period of weeks. But I could not see any\\r\\nspecific thing being done, any part of the building come off and move\\r\\naway. All such details were too rapid—far too rapid. What I saw,\\r\\nrather, was the<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_32\">[Pg 32]</a></span> <i>effect</i> of movement; a change of aspect, not the\\r\\nmovement itself. The building progressively looked smaller, until at\\r\\nlast it was not there.</p>\\r\\n<p>Then another building began rising in its place. It grew steadily. It\\r\\nwas as if I were blinking, and between each blink, with an unseen\\r\\nmovement, it had leaped upward another story. It seemed a skeleton at\\r\\nfirst, and then it was clothed. I watched it, ignoring others further\\r\\naway, until it stood complete—a full block in depth and thirty or forty\\r\\nstories high.</p>\\r\\n<p>I began to realize now the tremendous acceleration of time velocity I\\r\\nwas undergoing. The year-dial pointer very soon had moved to ten years;\\r\\nthe pointer of the century-dial was stirring. Again I glanced at the\\r\\nclock. It was after eleven; I had been gone about an hour and a quarter.</p>\\r\\n<p>There was nothing that I had to do, and I moved about the cabin, looking\\r\\nout of each of the windows in turn. The city was rising; not one\\r\\nbuilding, but hundreds. As my time velocity increased, I could no longer\\r\\nsee them come and go individually. They were there—and then they were\\r\\nwere gone, and others always larger and higher were in their stead.</p>\\r\\n<p>So I say the city was rising, coming up to meet me as I hung a thousand\\r\\nfeet or more above it. Already one gigantic edifice to the south seemed\\r\\nto rear its spire far above me. The edges of the island stayed low, a\\r\\nfringe of the new and old mingled; but down the backbone, roughly\\r\\nfollowing Broadway, great piles of steel and masonry were coming up.</p>\\r\\n<p>To the southeast I could make out the bridges over the river. There were\\r\\nothers now, extraordinarily broad and high, dwarfing the older ones that\\r\\nstood neglected beside them.</p>\\r\\n<p>It was a period of tremendous activity. And suddenly I discovered that\\r\\nthe southern half of Central Park was obliterated. I had drifted a\\r\\nlittle further north and was over it. A building was rising, coming up\\r\\ntoward me so swiftly that its outlines were blurred and shadowy. I was\\r\\ngazing down through the window in the floor of the cabin, and<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_33\">[Pg 33]</a></span> caught a\\r\\nvague impression of a network of gigantic steel girders almost\\r\\nunderneath the machine.</p>\\r\\n<p>I was too low. I ascended perhaps another thousand feet. When I was\\r\\nagain hanging stationary, I found beneath me a tremendous terraced\\r\\nbuilding—a pyramid with its apex sliced off. To the north and south it\\r\\nconnected with others of its kind; giant structures generally of pyramid\\r\\nshape, with streets running along their steplike terraces. Innumerable\\r\\nbridges connected these mammoth buildings, so that north and south, and\\r\\nfor a few blocks east and west of the center, there were continuous\\r\\naerial streets, in some places as many as ten or fifteen, one above the\\r\\nother.</p>\\r\\n<p>I turned to the window facing the north. There was now nothing but\\r\\nbuildings as far as my line of vision extended; buildings like a ridge\\r\\ndown the center, shading off to the lower areas of the east and west.\\r\\nThere were trees and parks in spots on the top, but the original ground\\r\\nwas covered.</p>\\r\\n<p>Some of the upper street levels—those alternate sections of terraces\\r\\nand bridges over courtyards whose ground was merely the rooftops of\\r\\nlower edifices—were laid with gleaming rails. And rearing itself above\\r\\neverything, a skeleton structure of monorails stretched north and\\r\\nsouth—eight or ten single rails paralleled at widths of some fifty\\r\\nfeet, which I realized must be carrying some system of aerial railroad.</p>\\r\\n<p>This towering pile was indeed the backbone of the city, extending\\r\\nroughly north and south like a mountain range that forms the backbone of\\r\\na continent. The lower areas adjacent—five hundred feet above the\\r\\nground, perhaps—were for the most part buildings with broad, flat\\r\\nroofs.</p>\\r\\n<p>In New Jersey, on Long Island, and north of Manhattan as far as I could\\r\\nsee, lesser cities had appeared, with occasional giants among buildings\\r\\nthat were lower. The whole was now welded into one, for the rivers on\\r\\neach side of me were spanned by a bridge at almost every street; a\\r\\nnetwork of bridges under which the water flowed almost unnoticed.</p>\\r\\n<p>My time-velocity was still accelerating. I saw now, in<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_34\">[Pg 34]</a></span>creasingly, many\\r\\nthings about the city that were shadowy—structures that were erected\\r\\nand stood no more than twenty or thirty years, perhaps, which to my\\r\\nvision now was only a moment. I became aware, not only below me, but\\r\\neven above me, of occasional vague aerial structures; skeletons that\\r\\nreared themselves up a few thousand feet and dissipated into nothing\\r\\nbefore I could form a conception of their real nature.</p>\\r\\n<p>There was, indeed, everywhere this shadowy aspect as to detail. Changes\\r\\nwere taking place; things were being done even the effect of which was\\r\\ntoo fleeting for my vision to grasp.</p>\\r\\n<p>I was constantly losing more details, but in general the growth of the\\r\\ncity was outward and upward. Presently there came a pause, as though the\\r\\ncity were resting. Occasional areas were blurred by their changing form;\\r\\nacross the river in Jersey a tremendous tower was rising into the sky\\r\\nfar above me. But as a whole the scene had quieted. My brain was\\r\\nconfused by what I had tried to observe and comprehend. I found myself\\r\\nhungry and a little faint. I dropped into my seat.</p>\\r\\n<p>The dials beside me caught my attention. The century-dial pointer had\\r\\npassed eighteen. Eighteen hundred years, and approaching two thousand\\r\\neven as I sat staring at it. The clock marked one forty. I had been gone\\r\\nalmost four hours. I said the city was resting. That is true. The growth\\r\\nof two thousand years had carried it to splendors of mechanical\\r\\nperfection that I could only guess at. But now it seemed to have reached\\r\\nits height; the summit of human achievement had been attained.</p>\\r\\n<p>I waited and watched through another period. There were changes, but\\r\\nthey were minor. I suppose all the buildings and various structures\\r\\ndecayed and were replenished. I do not know. The changes were too\\r\\nfleeting for me to see, and the general form remained the same.</p>\\r\\n<p>I was at what seemed the pinnacle of civilization, where mankind was\\r\\nresting and enjoying the results of its labors.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_35\">[Pg 35]</a></span> Decadence was bound to\\r\\ncome, as truly as death followed birth.</p>\\r\\n<p>The clock now recorded two fifty. I had been gone five hours. The\\r\\ncentury-dial was beyond thirty-seven hundred years. Two thousand years\\r\\nof growth upward from our own time-world, and only two thousand more of\\r\\nresting on the summit before the inevitable decline began. He who stands\\r\\nstill, goes backward. And so it is with mankind as a whole. This\\r\\ntriumphant city went down almost as quickly at it had come up. And\\r\\nthrough the windows of that cabin I watched it—neglected a little at\\r\\nfirst, then more and more as its softened masters, with nature turned\\r\\nagainst them, became unable to cope with it, until at last it broke up\\r\\nand sank back into ruin, decay and desolation.</p>\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 65%;\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER FOUR</h2>\\r\\n<p>Occasionally, now, some brave effort seemed to be made to build the city\\r\\non a different scale. There were other types of architecture, always\\r\\nsmaller; little sections, newly built, stood heroically, surrounded by\\r\\ngigantic, moldy ruins. Suddenly I realized that it was a dead city at\\r\\nwhich I was staring. There were no longer changes, except those natural\\r\\nto the passing years. The city was deserted; its inhabitants had died or\\r\\nhad fled—or both.</p>\\r\\n<p>It was after five o\\'clock. The dials registered just short of eight\\r\\nthousand years. I had less to see now, and I could give my attention to\\r\\nother things. The ruins of a dead city do not remain long in visible\\r\\nexistence. Two thousand years more were recorded. Beneath me the\\r\\nvegetation seemed untouched by the hand of man; only in a few scattered\\r\\nplaces<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_36\">[Pg 36]</a></span> were there any remaining ruins: a tumbledown segment of\\r\\nbuilding; the broken base of a tower; skeletons of crumbling steel here\\r\\nand there; headstones on the grave of what once had been a city.</p>\\r\\n<p>With these changes the contour of the landscape itself was forced to my\\r\\nattention. The rivers had changed; they were broader. South of Manhattan\\r\\nIsland, and somewhat to the west, I could distinguish a great expanse of\\r\\nwater. All the lowlands there—the \"Meadows,\" as we call them—had sunk.\\r\\nTo the north, the land seemed higher than normal, and an arm of the sea\\r\\nhad crept in up there to lap the foothills.</p>\\r\\n<p>I have not told you of the temperature I was experiencing. When I\\r\\nstarted there was an almost immediate drop—a blending of day and night,\\r\\nwinter and summer. It penetrated into the cabin, making the ship almost\\r\\ncold after the warm August evening of my departure.</p>\\r\\n<p>Now, however, at seven o\\'clock, when I had been gone some nine hours, I\\r\\nfelt that it was growing noticeably colder. And the faintest suggestion\\r\\nof a vague whiteness began to creep into the scene below me. That is an\\r\\nodd way for me to phrase it. I was seeing each minute only the <i>effect</i>\\r\\nof the snowfalls of thirty winters, blended with all the other seasons.\\r\\nThe snowfalls were increasing in severity; I became aware of that in the\\r\\naspect of the scene, but I cannot describe it.</p>\\r\\n<p>It was after seven o\\'clock now. I had been gone about nine and a half\\r\\nhours. The dials showed eleven thousand four hundred and fifty odd\\r\\nyears. I now faced a new problem: the landscape we had seen in our\\r\\nexperiment had nothing in it of great duration. How could I find it, or\\r\\ntell when I had reached its time? That house in which the girl was held\\r\\ncaptive could stand no more than a hundred years, if that. And it was\\r\\nthe only distinguishing mark in the whole scene. I would pass the\\r\\nlifetime of that house in a minute or two. I puzzled over this for quite\\r\\na while. I had almost decided to stop and verify the actual, momentary\\r\\nconditions beneath me. And then I realized I still had far to go. There<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_37\">[Pg 37]</a></span>\\r\\nwere trees, plenty of them, beneath me. They were constantly shifting\\r\\nand changing, but quite distinguishable, nevertheless. And in the\\r\\nenclosure about that house, Father and I had seen a tree—the only tree\\r\\nin the landscape. It was a curious looking tree, stunted, and with a\\r\\nlook of the far north about it. These below me, at eleven and twelve\\r\\nthousand years ahead of our present, were more or less normal looking\\r\\ntrees—or they probably would have been, had I stopped to examine them.</p>\\r\\n<p>I still had far to travel, so I increased the current from the tenth to\\r\\nthe fifteenth intensity. Again I was conscious of that feeling of\\r\\nlightness in my head, and the humming and vibration of everything\\r\\nincreased. I had almost forgotten my personal sensations; had quite\\r\\nforgotten them, in fact, for several hours past.</p>\\r\\n<p>I passed fifteen thousand years. I could see that the ocean to the north\\r\\nhad come further inland. There was now, from my altitude, no evidence of\\r\\nmankind visible, nor anything to indicate that man had ever lived on\\r\\nthis earth. The scene was more blurred now and grayer. I could still\\r\\nmake out the bay to the south, with a range of hills on Staten Island\\r\\nand water behind it and to the west as far as I could see. The rivers\\r\\nbounding Manhattan were still there, but the Palisades along the Hudson\\r\\nhad broken down.</p>\\r\\n<p>Directly beneath me was forest. I believed I had not drifted much from\\r\\nmy original position. I was still over where Central Park had been some\\r\\ntwenty thousand years before. The forest—it was more like\\r\\nwoods—covered a narrow rolling country between the two rivers. I knew I\\r\\nwas moving through time much more swiftly now, perhaps twice as fast as\\r\\nbefore. The vegetation was blurred, almost distorted. It was changing\\r\\nconstantly and, on the whole, was growing sparser, more stunted. It was\\r\\nas though I were traveling northward, or ascending a mountain almost to\\r\\nthe timber line. Another interval passed. My time-velocity had so\\r\\nincreased that once I thought I could see a hill rising. But that\\r\\nprobably was imagination.</p>\\r\\n<p>I had been gone some twelve hours—it was almost ten<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_38\">[Pg 38]</a></span> o\\'clock—when I\\r\\nrealized I was about exhausted. My head was reeling; my eyes burned and\\r\\nwatered. It was growing much colder—so cold that I switched on the\\r\\nelectrical heating apparatus.</p>\\r\\n<p>That was when the dials recorded between twenty and thirty thousand\\r\\nyears. I don\\'t remember exactly. I was confused. The scene beneath me\\r\\nwas noticeably whiter, and I was now drifting to the south. I felt\\r\\nperturbed. I was going too far.</p>\\r\\n<p>I had reached about forty-five thousand years when abruptly I realized\\r\\nthat there was no vegetation in the scene! Just when it melted away I\\r\\nhad not noticed. It was all a whitish blur, now, that suggested very\\r\\nsnowy winters blended with a shorter summer season. I leaped to the\\r\\ncontrol, and threw its handle back, pausing an instant at each intensity\\r\\nof current until I had come to the first. There I left it.</p>\\r\\n<p>These new sensations of decreasing my time-velocity so abruptly were\\r\\nalmost equally as severe as those when I started. The humming slowed up.\\r\\nMy whole body seemed to be turning to lead—or freezing. I was heavy,\\r\\nstiff, and cold. I was standing up, and I managed to grip the side of\\r\\nthe cabin for support, and reaching down, I threw off the switch,\\r\\ncutting off the current completely. There came a tremendous, soundless\\r\\nclap in my head; I seemed tumbling headlong into an abyss of blackness.</p>\\r\\n<p>I do not think I lost consciousness. My senses reeled for what seemed an\\r\\nage, but was doubtlessly only a second or two. I fell into a chair and\\r\\nthe horrible dizziness passed. I raised my head and looked about me.</p>\\r\\n<p>My first impression was of the extraordinary solidity of the cabin\\r\\ninterior. I had not realized how shadowy it had been before. Two little\\r\\nelectric bulbs were burning overhead. They illuminated the compartment.\\r\\nThe windows were black rectangles; It was night outside.</p>\\r\\n<p>I was cold; I could see my breath in the chill of the room, even though\\r\\none of the electric heaters was in operation. Everything close to me was\\r\\noppressively silent; the humming still seemed to persist vaguely, but I\\r\\nknew it was<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_39\">[Pg 39]</a></span> only the reaction from it roaring in my ears. From the next\\r\\ncompartment came the drone of the Frazia motors.</p>\\r\\n<p>When I had fairly recovered normality, I went to the nearest window. The\\r\\nsky was blue-black. There was no moon and the stars seemed a trifle\\r\\nhazy. Beneath me I could make out a barren expanse of snow. I checked my\\r\\ncompass. Its needle had steadied now, and I saw that my drift was almost\\r\\ndirectly south. The ship was moving rapidly, and I was alarmed. I knew\\r\\nthat, even with the compass, I could easily get lost—geographically, so\\r\\nto speak.</p>\\r\\n<p>My first action was to ascend. When I was up some six thousand feet I\\r\\nstarted back northward, against the wind.</p>\\r\\n<p>I was hopelessly lost, both in time and in space. I could distinguish\\r\\nnothing in the starlit, snowy landscape that seemed familiar. Whether or\\r\\nnot I had passed the time world I was seeking, I had no idea. Then I\\r\\nflew low, skimming the snow no more than one or two hundred feet above\\r\\nit. There were houses! Huts would be a better word. I think they were\\r\\nbuilt of snow, but I could not tell. It seemed an Arctic world.</p>\\r\\n<p>I knew then I had gone too far in time. I decided to stay near here in\\r\\nspace until morning. Fortunately that proved only a short time away.\\r\\nWithin half an hour the stars paled; twilight came and passed, and the\\r\\nsun rose—a huge, red, glowing ball.</p>\\r\\n<p>I was circling about, quite high—six or eight thousand feet possibly.\\r\\nBy this reddish light of early morning I could see the bay south of me.\\r\\nThere was no Long Island; the ocean had closed in to the north and east,\\r\\nand I was near its shore—a cold, snowy beach, with lazy rollers. But\\r\\nwest of me there was a river—the Hudson, I was sure—double the breadth\\r\\nof one I had known. It seemed to come from a mountainous region in the\\r\\nnorthwest, and an arm of it north of Manhattan emptied into the sea.</p>\\r\\n<p>Everywhere there was snow. The bay was full of floating ice. Across the\\r\\nriver was an area of stunted trees. I was over Manhattan Island, I was\\r\\nsure. I circled around, searching. It was not the time world I was\\r\\nseeking—that was obvious.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_40\">[Pg 40]</a></span> Should I go on, or go back through the\\r\\ncenturies I had passed? I decided on the latter.</p>\\r\\n<p>I had now been away from you nearly sixteen hours. I was worn out. I\\r\\nflew across the river, found a level plateau to the north. There was no\\r\\nsign of human habitation in the vicinity. Shutting off my Frazia motors\\r\\ncompletely, I descended and came to rest on the surface of the snow, in\\r\\na time world forty-six thousand and eight years beyond our present. I\\r\\nate a little and, dropping to the floor of the cabin, fell asleep.\\r\\nUnwise maybe, but I had to take a chance.</p>\\r\\n<p>At any rate, I awakened without having been disturbed. It was night\\r\\nagain; I had slept some twelve hours. I flew upward, back over Manhattan\\r\\nIsland, and threw the opposite proton current into its first intensity.</p>\\r\\n<p>I need not go into further details. My sensations were the same as\\r\\nbefore, though they bothered me less as I grew more accustomed to them.\\r\\nI came back through time. At intervals I stopped and examined the\\r\\nlandscape.</p>\\r\\n<p>The wind was blowing almost continually from the north during all these\\r\\ncenturies. I flew into it slowly, keeping my approximate position\\r\\nwithout great difficulty. I tried to hold myself near the south center\\r\\nof the island, and look northward. I was right in going back through\\r\\ntime, I soon discovered. From close to the ground where I stopped once,\\r\\nI could see a rolling hill near by that had a familiar contour. I cannot\\r\\ndescribe it to you, but once I saw it from that angle, I knew it was in\\r\\nthe landscape we had seen from the laboratory.</p>\\r\\n<p>Then I found the tree. There was no house. No snow, either, for I had\\r\\nchanced then to stop in a summer season. The tree was too small. I chose\\r\\na ten years later time world, and watching the dials closely, descended\\r\\nat a period ten and a half years later. I had struck it exactly; it must\\r\\nhave been within a week or two from the time world Father and I had\\r\\nobserved.</p>\\r\\n<p>I had occupied some eight hours with this search. The dials had stopped\\r\\nnow at twenty-eight thousand two hundred odd years. I was at that\\r\\ninstant flying at an altitude<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_41\">[Pg 41]</a></span> of no more than a few hundred feet. It\\r\\nwas again early morning, just after sunrise, and there was that\\r\\nfamiliar, snowy landscape we had seen from the laboratory.</p>\\r\\n<p>The house, with its enclosure and outbuildings, lay below me. I circled\\r\\nover it, staring down through the floor window. The Frazia motors are\\r\\ngreatly muffled, as you know, but, even so, their sound carried down to\\r\\nthe house. A figure came out into the enclosure, and stared upward at\\r\\nme. It was the girl—in a fur garment, but bareheaded—watching my\\r\\nplane. Before I could think what to do, three huge dogs, each of them\\r\\nthe size of a pony, came leaping from one of the outbuildings and stood\\r\\nin a group, snarling at me with such volume and power that they made my\\r\\nblood run cold.</p>\\r\\n<p>I was circling slowly over the house, cursing my lack of caution and\\r\\nstill too confused to do anything, when the figure of a man appeared in\\r\\nthe enclosure, clad in furs and bareheaded like the girl. He stood head\\r\\nand shoulders over her. Evidently the noise of the dogs blotted out the\\r\\nsound of my motors. He did not look up into the air, but striding\\r\\nangrily to the girl, struck her in the face with the flat of his hand.\\r\\nThen he dragged her, cowering, into the house.</p>\\r\\n<p>I straightened out, and flew south. The howling of the dogs died away.\\r\\nWithout realizing where I was going, I headed down the wind. Soon I was\\r\\nover the water. I had risen, and in the morning light could see the\\r\\nlandlocked bay into which the main channel of the Hudson emptied. The\\r\\nbay itself had an entrance to the sea almost at the river\\'s mouth.</p>\\r\\n<p>It was midwinter, I learned afterward. The river and the bay both seemed\\r\\nfrozen over, with a mantle of snow on their ice. I passed above an\\r\\nisland—Staten Island, no doubt—and mechanically swung to the west.</p>\\r\\n<p>What was I to do? I had several rifles in the plane, as you know, and\\r\\none of the latest Collinger hand guns. My instinct was to land at the\\r\\nhouse boldly, overawe its inmates with my weapons, and carry off the\\r\\ngirl. That was a fatuous thought. I very soon realized that for all I\\r\\nknew they might<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_42\">[Pg 42]</a></span> have the power to strike me dead with some weapon\\r\\ntotally unknown.</p>\\r\\n<p>I was still flying west. I found myself far out over Jersey, and still I\\r\\nhad decided nothing. There were houses beneath me and even a little\\r\\nvillage or two. But I did not heed them, though fortunately I had sense\\r\\nenough to ascend to a higher altitude where I could escape observation.</p>\\r\\n<p>The sun was rising above the sea behind me, and at last I swung about to\\r\\nface it. As it mounted higher—it was moving at about normal speed—some\\r\\nof the red, glowing look was lost; it assumed more of its familiar\\r\\naspects of our own time world. But still an hour above the horizon as it\\r\\nwas now, I could stare at it quite steadily without being blinded.</p>\\r\\n<p>I was heading east. In another ten minutes I would have been back in\\r\\nManhattan. I decided that I would leave the plane secluded somewhere and\\r\\napproach the house on foot, quietly. If I could only elude the dogs and\\r\\nnot arouse them, I hoped to be able to get into the house and get the\\r\\ngirl out. I realize now it was a foolhardy plan.</p>\\r\\n<p>I flew very low up the Hudson from its mouth. I was afraid I might be\\r\\nseen. Then it suddenly occurred to me how easily I could avoid that with\\r\\ncertainty. I threw the switch of the proton current into the first and\\r\\nthen the second intensity, and began a slow time flight forward through\\r\\nthe day simultaneously with my flight up the river.</p>\\r\\n<p>I found a good hiding place for the plane on the east bank of the\\r\\nriver—a broad, flat sort of gully some two hundred feet wide. I figured\\r\\nthis was about abreast of the house, and I lowered the plane into it. It\\r\\nwas difficult to do because of my southward drift, but I managed it. As\\r\\nI neared the ground I shut off the proton current and came to rest in\\r\\ntime and space almost at the same moment.</p>\\r\\n<p>The sun was just setting behind a line of hills across the river. As I\\r\\nhad not eaten for several hours, I sat in the cabin now and ate,\\r\\nplanning exactly what I should do to rescue the girl.</p>\\r\\n<p>You will not understand it, but as I sat there, alone, with no one to\\r\\nconsult, it did not seem to me so desperate an<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_43\">[Pg 43]</a></span> enterprise. My\\r\\nCollinger, no bigger than your hand, would silently fire a dozen bullets\\r\\nin as many seconds, each capable of killing a human, or one of those\\r\\ndogs.</p>\\r\\n<p>It was the dogs I was most afraid of. And yet, as I had observed from\\r\\nthe laboratory, they did not run loose about the grounds at night, but\\r\\nwere trained to stay in the kennel, which was some distance from the\\r\\ndwelling...three or four hundred feet, perhaps.</p>\\r\\n<p>I decided to start about midnight. My clock gave a totally different\\r\\nhour, of course, from the correct one of that particular time world. But\\r\\nI was planning to leave the plane about six hours after sunset.</p>\\r\\n<p>It was a long evening, but the time finally arrived. I put on my fur\\r\\ncoat and went bareheaded, because I wanted to look as rational to\\r\\nthe girl as possible. At best she would be afraid of me, a\\r\\nstranger—probably more afraid of me than of her captors. I realized\\r\\nfully what a difficulty that would be. An outcry from her, or any\\r\\nresistance on her part, might lose me everything. But my intentions\\r\\nwere the best, though she could not know it.</p>\\r\\n<p>I left the plane. Besides the Collinger, I had a hand compass and a\\r\\nsmall flashlight. It was very cold. I scrambled out through the snow, up\\r\\nthe side of the gulley to the level land above—a climb of sixty or\\r\\nseventy feet. The snow was deep, with an underlying surface of ice that\\r\\nwould support my weight. Up here on the higher land it was colder than\\r\\never. The north wind hit me full, and I had been walking no more than\\r\\nfive minutes when it began to snow—tremendous flakes, that soon came in\\r\\na thick, soft cloud, and blotted out everything around me. In my pocket\\r\\nI had my fur cap with ear tabs, and I soon found I would have to wear\\r\\nit.</p>\\r\\n<p>I was heading across the wind, plowing through the loose snow. I could\\r\\nsee only a few feet ahead of me. It was a pathless waste. And suddenly\\r\\nthe whimsical thought came over me that I was crossing Fifty-ninth\\r\\nStreet, and soon I would be near Columbus Circle. It was the same space,\\r\\nthe same<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_44\">[Pg 44]</a></span> location. Nothing was different but the time—the changes time\\r\\nhad brought.</p>\\r\\n<p>I took out my compass and, by the light of the flashlight, I consulted\\r\\nit. I was heading as nearly as I could toward the house. So far as I had\\r\\nbeen able to tell before, there was no other habitation on the island. I\\r\\nsuppose I struggled along for nearly an hour. I figured I must be in the\\r\\nvicinity of the house now, though I could see nothing but the snow\\r\\ncovered ground a few feet ahead of me, the whirling flakes close at\\r\\nhand, and the blackness overhead. Without warning, through a rift in the\\r\\nclouds to the east, came moonlight; a gigantic, egg-shaped moon with a\\r\\nreddish tinge to it that gave the scene a lurid, extremely weird look.</p>\\r\\n<p>The house was in sight, ahead and to the left, on a slight rise of\\r\\nground no more than a quarter of a mile away. I was faced now with the\\r\\nnecessity for a definite course of action. From the laboratory, with my\\r\\ntelescope, I had occasionally seen the girl late at night, sitting in\\r\\nthe central living room of the house. I had seen her through the\\r\\nwindows, and she had always left the living room in a southeast\\r\\ndirection. The house faced south; I felt that her room was in the\\r\\nsoutheast end. The enclosure lay mostly behind the house, toward the\\r\\nnorth, with the dog kennel in its extreme northern wall.</p>\\r\\n<p>This was all advantageous to me. I knew I had to keep away from those\\r\\ndogs. With a wind of from twenty to thirty miles an hour blowing from\\r\\nthem to me, I felt sure that they would not get my scent. My plan was to\\r\\nget into the house through either a sort of gateway in the southeast\\r\\nwall of the enclosure, or directly in through a window. I expected to\\r\\nlocate the girl and carry here away—by force, I suppose. I was\\r\\nconfident—absurdly so, I realize now. I think it was the\\r\\nenthusiasm—the excitement—of being actually engaged in what I had\\r\\ncontemplated for two long years and had worked so hard to attain.</p>\\r\\n<p>My heart was beating fast as I crept forward, the Collinger in my gloved\\r\\nhand. It was still snowing hard, and presently the clouds swept back\\r\\nover the newly risen moon; but I was<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_45\">[Pg 45]</a></span> now so close up that I could see\\r\\nthe dark outlines of the house, and the wall of the enclosure.</p>\\r\\n<p>The building was only one story, but quite high, with a queer looking\\r\\noverhanging roof. The wall of the enclosure was some ten feet high. I\\r\\ncircled to the south, and was soon close up to the main doorway of the\\r\\nhouse. The whole place was piled with snow. There was not a sound, only\\r\\nthe howling of the wind as it swept in gusts under the low eaves.</p>\\r\\n<p>The glass door—I suppose it was glass—was a single rectangular pane in\\r\\na dark, narrow frame. It was no more than three feet broad, and at least\\r\\ntwelve feet high. Behind it I could see the dimly lighted interior—a\\r\\nsoft, blue-white light. I could not see where it came from.</p>\\r\\n<p>For quite a while I must have stood there motionless, peering in. A\\r\\nportion of a large room was in the line of my sight; It seemed\\r\\nunoccupied. I could see a back wall hung with something dark; a sort of\\r\\nlow couch to one side; queerly shaped, low chairs and a table or two.\\r\\nAnd there was a floor covering of some thick, soft textile, and several\\r\\nfurs lying about. A large fur rug covered the couch.</p>\\r\\n<p>To the right I could see a low archway, hung with a curtain. That was in\\r\\nthe direction of the girl\\'s room. There were two other archways with\\r\\ncurtains, but evidently no interior doors to the house.</p>\\r\\n<p>I had been pressing against the glass pane; it seemed to give a little.\\r\\nI pushed. The motion was inward, and greater at the bottom. I knelt down\\r\\nand shoved it. The lower half swung silently and smoothly inward and\\r\\nupward, while the upper half came out and down. The whole twelve foot\\r\\npane was pivoted at its center. When it paralleled the floor it stopped,\\r\\nand there was a six foot opening leading into the house.</p>\\r\\n<p>I took a cautious step, listening intently, peering around me—behind\\r\\nme—with the sudden feeling that something supernatural might leap forth\\r\\nand spring at me any instant.</p>\\r\\n<p>But the Collinger, my finger on the trigger, gave me courage. In my left\\r\\nhand I held the flashlight, and very slow<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_46\">[Pg 46]</a></span>ly I crept toward the\\r\\ncurtained archway behind which I hoped the girl might be. Suddenly I\\r\\nremembered my cap. I smiled at the absurdity of the detail, but,\\r\\nnevertheless, I pulled it off and stuffed it in my pocket. Then I went\\r\\nforward, pushed aside the curtain, and entered the space behind it.</p>\\r\\n<p>I was in darkness as the curtain dropped. It must have been a sort of\\r\\nanteroom, or a short hallway, for some twenty feet ahead of me I saw\\r\\nanother curtain with a blue radiance beyond it.</p>\\r\\n<p>A moment more and I had pushed aside the second curtain and stood\\r\\npeering into the room beyond. It was more dimly lighted than the living\\r\\nroom. Across it, in a angle of wall, the first thing my gaze caught was\\r\\na low couch or divan, bathed in the blue radiance from a brazier beside\\r\\nit, which left the rest of the room in gloom. The girl lay there asleep.\\r\\nA soft, pure-white fur was covering her, but her bare arms and shoulders\\r\\nwere above it. One arm was crooked under her head for a pillow; the\\r\\nother, almost as white as the rug, lay stretched out over the fur. On\\r\\nher breast, her golden hair lay in waves.</p>\\r\\n<p>I stood transfixed by the ethereal loveliness of the face, calm in deep\\r\\nslumber. It was a small oval face of seemingly perfect features, with\\r\\nsoft, curving red lips, smooth, rosy cheeks and long, silken lashes that\\r\\nlay motionless as she slept.</p>\\r\\n<p>My emotion at the picture was short lived; other thoughts crowded up me.\\r\\nWhat was I to do? I could not awaken the girl and ask her to come with\\r\\nme. She would not understand the words, and if she did, she would\\r\\nprobably have screamed before I could get them out. Seize her, stifle\\r\\nher cries and carry her off forcibly? Perhaps that is what I should have\\r\\ndone; taken her to the plane and left explanations until afterward.</p>\\r\\n<p>But I could not bring myself to do that. Somehow, my whole instinct was\\r\\nto retreat from the room. I felt myself a gross intruder in a sanctified\\r\\nplace, my very gaze an insult. What I would finally have done, I don\\'t\\r\\nknow. Events<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_47\">[Pg 47]</a></span> took the decision out of my hands. The wind outside roared\\r\\nwith a sudden gust that must have pulled loose something under the\\r\\neaves. There came a rattle, a thump, loud in the silence of the house.\\r\\nThen the wind died again.</p>\\r\\n<p>I glanced up to the ceiling, startled, with my heart pounding and the\\r\\nCollinger pointed toward the sound. I could see nothing but the dark\\r\\nrectangle of a window up there. My gaze fell again to the couch—and met\\r\\nthe opened eyes of the girl. She was sitting up, her hair tumbling over\\r\\nher shoulders, one hand instinctively gripping the white fur to raise it\\r\\nmore closely about her, the other pressed against her mouth. I think I\\r\\ncould never imagine an expression of more utter terror than that on her\\r\\nface.</p>\\r\\n<p>I murmured something intended to be reassuring and made the mistake of\\r\\ntaking a step forward. It was the worst thing I could have done, for her\\r\\nfrightened scream rang out through the house. I guess by then I was\\r\\nthoroughly confused. I turned back toward the curtain. I would escape\\r\\nfrom the house—come back some other time. Or should I pick her up now,\\r\\nand run with her? She was small, frail. I could carry her easily; escape\\r\\nalmost as quickly with her, perhaps, as by myself. And shoot back at\\r\\nanyone—anything—that followed.</p>\\r\\n<p>I found myself back at her couch. She had withdrawn to the further side\\r\\nof it, huddled against the wall. Her horrified eyes were on my face, but\\r\\nshe did not scream again.</p>\\r\\n<p>There was a noise behind me, and I swung about. The curtain was parting.\\r\\nThere was a figure there. I could not see it plainly; it was in the\\r\\ndarkness, and I was in the light. I aimed the Collinger, pressed the\\r\\ntrigger. Simultaneously, a tiny pencil-point of light seemed to spring\\r\\nat me from where the figure was standing. A brief, very tiny but\\r\\nhorribly intense glare flashed in my eyes.</p>\\r\\n<p>I was in darkness; everything went black. I did not fall, but reeled\\r\\nsidewise. I heard a mocking laugh and footsteps coming toward me; a hand\\r\\nstruck me across the mouth.</p>\\r\\n<p>It is terrible to fight in total darkness. I stumbled aimlessly\\r\\nsomewhere, and felt the Collinger twisted from me. But<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_48\">[Pg 48]</a></span> when I lurched\\r\\nin that direction, my outflung arms met only empty air. Again a hand\\r\\nstruck me across the mouth; again that mocking laugh. My assailant was\\r\\nplaying with me.</p>\\r\\n<p>I was unhurt, and desperately I rushed to where I thought the room\\'s\\r\\nexit might be. But strong fingers gripped my shoulder and I was flung\\r\\nviolently sidewise. I must have struck my head against something as I\\r\\nwent down. My senses faded; the last thing I remember was that jeering,\\r\\nmocking laughter floating out of the darkness.</p>\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 65%;\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER FIVE</h2>\\r\\n<p>When I came to, I was still lying where I had fallen. Striking my head\\r\\nhad knocked me out momentarily. I heard voices; some one was kneeling\\r\\nbeside me. I opened my eyes, but everything was black. I remember\\r\\nfeeling my head; It was not cut. I was unhurt, and I struggled to a\\r\\nsitting position. Whoever it was beside me, now stood up and moved away.\\r\\nThe girl\\'s voice came to me out of the darkness. The low words were\\r\\nunintelligible—yet they were words not wholly unfamiliar in ring.</p>\\r\\n<p>The darkness was full of little darting red spots. And my eyes pained\\r\\nme; the backs of my eyeballs were burning. I was blind. I had thought\\r\\nthe light in the room had suddenly been extinguished, and a vague idea\\r\\nthat my antagonist could see in the dark had possessed me. But it wasn\\'t\\r\\nso. He had blinded me with the tiny flash of light that had struck into\\r\\nmy eyes.</p>\\r\\n<p>My head was still reeling from the blow it had received when I fell.\\r\\nThey carried me, half conscious, into some other<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_49\">[Pg 49]</a></span> room, and left me\\r\\nlying on something soft. I closed my eyes, but I could not shut out\\r\\nthose darting red spots. At last, I must have drifted off to sleep.</p>\\r\\n<p>When I awoke it was morning. The red glow of the sunrise was coming in\\r\\nthrough a small aperture up near the ceiling. I could see it; the\\r\\nblindness had passed. My head was still ringing and my eyes still pained\\r\\nme, but I was uninjured. I was on a low couch, with a fur rug under me.\\r\\nMy overcoat lay beside me on the floor. The whole thing seemed like a\\r\\ndream, but finally I got it straightened out in my mind.</p>\\r\\n<p>I was in a fairly large bedroom. Two windows of heavy transparent\\r\\nmaterial were up near the ceiling. Opposite the windows was a doorway\\r\\nwith a curtain. I slipped into my overcoat, searching its pockets. My\\r\\ncap was there, but the compass and the flashlight were gone and my\\r\\nCollinger had already been taken from me.</p>\\r\\n<p>The storm outside seemed to have passed. The house was dead silent. I\\r\\nwent to the curtain; beyond it was a small hall, empty, and with another\\r\\ncurtain at its further end. This I pushed aside cautiously. I was\\r\\nlooking into the main living room of the house, and met the direct gaze\\r\\nof a man who was lounging there.</p>\\r\\n<p>I dropped the curtain hastily, but he had seen me and sprung to his\\r\\nfeet—a powerful man, taller than myself, with gray, loose-fitting\\r\\ntrousers and naked torso. I retreated back to the bedroom; the fear of\\r\\nwhat he might do to me, blind me or worse, made me anything but anxious\\r\\nto encounter him again.</p>\\r\\n<p>He followed and was upon me, twisting me by the shoulders to face him.\\r\\nHe was a man of about thirty-five with black hair, long to the base of\\r\\nhis neck; a smooth-shaven, strong, rugged face; keen gray eyes beneath\\r\\nblack, bushy brows; a nose a little like a hawk, and a wide mouth with\\r\\nthin lips. It was the sort of face that bespoke power and cruelty—a\\r\\nnature born to dominate its fellows. His gaze was searching, puzzled. I\\r\\nknew he was trying to make me out—wondering what manner of man I was,\\r\\nand where I<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_50\">[Pg 50]</a></span> had come from. He spoke to me. I could not understand the\\r\\nwords, but again I got the impression that they were familiar English\\r\\nwords spoken differently. I answered him. I don\\'t remember what I said,\\r\\nbut he frowned and pushed me from him, toward the couch.</p>\\r\\n<p>I had decided to appear docile. I stumbled to the couch and sat down on\\r\\nit. He stood in the center of the room, regarding me, and I managed what\\r\\nI hoped might be an ingratiating smile. This seemed to appeal to him,\\r\\nfor he smiled back. Then he swung about and left the room.</p>\\r\\n<p>For a while I sat quiet. The girl—where she was I did not know. I would\\r\\nhave escaped without her if I could, but escape did not seem possible;\\r\\nat least, it was more of a risk than I cared to take. The feeling came\\r\\nto me that even now as I sat on the couch, I might be observed. How\\r\\ncould I tell whether someone was watching me from behind some hidden\\r\\norifice, through which, as I turned my gaze that way, that tiny,\\r\\nblinding beam of light would spring at me?</p>\\r\\n<p>It was too big a chance. I would wait, and when I knew better what I had\\r\\nto contend with, watch for an opportunity to escape.</p>\\r\\n<p>The room was fairly light now, with that queer, reddish light. I could\\r\\nsee the sky, brilliant with a glorious red sunrise, through the little\\r\\nwindows overhead. I moved the table and climbed on it; outside was snow,\\r\\ntinged with red. I was at an east end of the house, perhaps next to the\\r\\ngirl\\'s room.</p>\\r\\n<p>At a corner of the building nearby sat one of the dogs—like a gigantic\\r\\nshaggy wolf, quiet but alert. His head was fully six feet above the\\r\\nground as he sat there, squatting on his haunches. He heard me open the\\r\\nwindow, and trotted quietly over to look at me. My fascinated stare met\\r\\nhis eyes squarely—eyes that seemed to hold an almost uncanny human\\r\\nintelligence. He seemed satisfied with the situation, for he trotted\\r\\nback to the corner of the house and sat down again. But he was still\\r\\nwatching me.</p>\\r\\n<p>I dropped to the floor. The incident had left me shuddering. What manner\\r\\nof brutes were these, with gleaming, tusk-like teeth, dripping jowls and\\r\\na power in those tre<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_51\">[Pg 51]</a></span>mendous muscles that must have far exceeded the\\r\\nstrongest horse! And eyes that might have been human! At that moment,\\r\\nescape seemed further away than ever.</p>\\r\\n<p>For three days they fed me in that room. A woman came mostly. She wore a\\r\\nloose, shapeless robe of dark cloth. It was dowdy-looking. Her hair was\\r\\niron-gray, long to her waist, twisted into a bundle and bound with\\r\\nstrips of dark cloth. Her face was thin, careworn. She brought me my\\r\\nfood; some kinds of cooked meats and starchy vegetables, like potatoes.\\r\\nShe was kind enough, but grim, as though I were an unpleasant task that\\r\\nher conscience made her discharge punctiliously.</p>\\r\\n<p>I tried to talk to her, but she couldn\\'t understand me, nor I her.\\r\\nAfterward, I learned she was the older man\\'s old maid daughter. The old\\r\\nman himself came in a few times; a smooth-shaven, stalwart man of about\\r\\nseventy, dressed in wide, flowing trousers and naked above the waist.\\r\\nSometimes he wore a short little house jacket. His name was Bool. The\\r\\nyounger man—the master of the house—was named Toroh. He came in and\\r\\nsat by me a few times, always intent on seeing that I was properly cared\\r\\nfor. But there was no mistaking the fact that he would have killed me\\r\\nwithout compunction had I annoyed him; and I could not forget his\\r\\nsardonic laughter when he had blinded me.</p>\\r\\n<p>I\\'ve been telling you about my first three days in the house. I did not\\r\\nsee the girl except once, just for a moment. I was not held to the room,\\r\\nalthough I stayed there almost constantly. And one or the other of those\\r\\ndogs was outside all the time. After the first day, I grew bold enough\\r\\nto go into the living room.</p>\\r\\n<p>Once, when I was sitting alone in the main room, the girl entered. She\\r\\nstood in the doorway, and for the first time I realized how small and\\r\\nslight she was. She looked almost Egyptian—I mean her manner of dress.\\r\\nShe was wearing a blue-colored cloth wound wide about her hips, with a\\r\\ndull red sash hanging knee-length down one side; sandals on her bare\\r\\nfeet; breastplates of metal, and a broad, low-cut collar of cloth with\\r\\nlittle coins on it that widened<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_52\">[Pg 52]</a></span> to cover her shoulders. And her golden\\r\\nhair was parted forward over her shoulders in plaits that ended with\\r\\nlittle tassels.</p>\\r\\n<p>She was standing there staring at me, and this time there was no fear in\\r\\nher eyes—only curiosity. My heart leaped; it was what I hoped for most.\\r\\nI could do nothing toward planning to get her out of the house as long\\r\\nas she continued to be afraid of me.</p>\\r\\n<p>I smiled at her in as inoffensive and friendly a fashion as I could. Her\\r\\neyes fell, then came up and I could see she was wondering at my clothes;\\r\\nmy shoes, trousers, shirt and tie. Abruptly I realized that, except for\\r\\nmy garb, I probably did not look extraordinary or frightening to her.\\r\\nThe thought gave me new courage. I stood up, and spoke. At once she\\r\\nturned and ran from the room.</p>\\r\\n<p>We were a strange household, but after a time, except for having my\\r\\nmeals alone, I found I could move about pretty freely. Once Toroh\\r\\nbrought me my electric torch, and, making sure I did not aim it at him,\\r\\nhe made me light it. I knew he believed it a weapon. I thought this a\\r\\ngood chance to convince him I was friendly. I smiled and shined it into\\r\\nmy eyes, to show him it was harmless. He grunted and, taking the\\r\\nflashlight from me, tossed it across the room, indicating it was of no\\r\\nuse or further interest.</p>\\r\\n<p>Then he produced my Collinger and made me show him how to operate it.\\r\\nBut he was too clever to let me hold it; he did not let it get out of\\r\\nhis hands. When he had fired it at a mark out the doorway, he grunted\\r\\nagain and laid it on the snow. At a distance of twenty feet he stood\\r\\nwith some object in his hand which he did not show me. Abruptly the\\r\\nCollinger flew into fragments! All its cartridges had been exploded\\r\\nsimultaneously. The bullets whistled past us, startling Toroh as much as\\r\\nthey did me. Later I learned he had exploded it by something akin to\\r\\nradio. He picked up the remains and when he got back into the house, he\\r\\ntossed my broken weapon away disdainfully. It was the attitude a soldier\\r\\nof today might have toward an Indian warrior and his bow and arrow.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_53\">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>Toroh, I learned later, thought I had come from another planet. He had\\r\\nseen my plane the morning I hovered over the house. No one from another\\r\\nplanet had been to the earth for centuries. But history told of them,\\r\\nand he thought I was one of them, come again. He treated me kindly\\r\\nenough—probably because I did not anger him or cross him in any way.\\r\\nBut I had seen him strike the girl in the face, and one day he struck\\r\\nthe woman. I have never seen such a look of sullen, repressed hatred as\\r\\nshe gave him. She seemed to hate her father, too. Later, I often saw him\\r\\ncuff her when she annoyed him.</p>\\r\\n<p>I have so much to tell you. Toroh took two of his dogs and his sled and\\r\\nwent away after about a week. He was gone a month, and during that time\\r\\nI stayed docilely in the house. I saw many opportunities when I might\\r\\nhave escaped. But now I would not, without taking the girl—whose name,\\r\\nby the way, is Azeela—and I could not expose her to such danger as\\r\\nalways seemed imminent.</p>\\r\\n<p>I must have convinced them all that I was harmless. No one paid me great\\r\\nattention except the woman, Koa. Often I would see her peering furtively\\r\\nat me from some distant doorway.</p>\\r\\n<p>Azeela soon became friendly, and since we both had nothing to do, she\\r\\ndevoted herself to learning our language. I tried to learn hers and\\r\\nfailed miserably. But she picked ours up with extraordinary\\r\\nrapidity—perhaps because her mind was quicker, her memory more\\r\\nretentive. And I think, also, because she has behind her the inherited\\r\\ninstincts of knowledge through all the centuries from our own time-world\\r\\nforward.</p>\\r\\n<p>Anyway, within the month she could speak English freely enough for us to\\r\\nget along—with a quaint little accent that is wholly indescribable.</p>\\r\\n<p>I think her language was derived very nearly from the English we speak\\r\\ntoday. Ours was, to her, merely archaic; but hers, modern beyond my\\r\\ntime, was too much for me. It was an extraordinary story that Azeela had\\r\\nto tell me—as extraordinary as mine must have seemed to her. We be<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_54\">[Pg 54]</a></span>came\\r\\nfriends, and with friendship came a renewed desire on both our parts to\\r\\nescape. Her people were many hundred miles away, and, when I told her of\\r\\nmy plane, I very soon persuaded her to let me take her back to her own\\r\\ncountry.</p>\\r\\n<p>Quite evidently my plane had not been discovered. If it had not snowed\\r\\nso heavily that first night, the dogs would have led Toroh back over my\\r\\ntrail to it. But it was still safe, though I did not know it then; and\\r\\nthe thought that it might have been found bothered me a lot, I can tell\\r\\nyou.</p>\\r\\n<p>We decided to try and escape. Toroh was expected back any day. We spent\\r\\na morning discussing it, planning it in detail. My weapons were gone,\\r\\nand Azeela did not know where they were. Bool had a cylinder of the\\r\\nblinding-flash—I call it that because their name for it would mean\\r\\nnothing to you—but we could not get it; he always kept it about his\\r\\nperson. The woman, Koa, we did not think was armed—though she might\\r\\nhave been.</p>\\r\\n<p>Toroh had taken two of the dogs. There was one left, and almost\\r\\ncontinually it was pacing about the house outside. We realized that even\\r\\nif we succeeded in getting away from the place, the dog would follow and\\r\\novertake us before we could reach the plane.</p>\\r\\n<p>Bool was in one of the outbuildings nearly all that morning. Koa was\\r\\nmoving about the house. We did not think she was listening to us; but\\r\\nshe was, and evidently she had picked up something of our\\r\\nlanguage—enough to give her the import of what we were discussing.</p>\\r\\n<p>She appeared suddenly, and with a furtive glance around, told Azeela she\\r\\nwould help us escape. Azeela translated it to me, and the woman nodded\\r\\ngrimly in confirmation. She was sorry for Azeela, and she hated Toroh\\r\\nsufficiently to want the girl out of his clutches.</p>\\r\\n<p>Koa\\'s plan was simple and it sounded eminently practical. She had no\\r\\nweapons, and did not know where any were, except for her father\\'s, and\\r\\nthat she would not dare try to secure. But late that afternoon Bool\\r\\nwould be in his room dozing. Koa would lock the dog in the kennel. Then\\r\\nwe would be free to depart.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_55\">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>The sun was almost setting that day when Koa informed us that the time\\r\\nhad come. We had restrained our excitement; Bool had apparently not\\r\\nnoticed anything unusual in our outward appearance during the day. He\\r\\nhad retired to his room as customary, and Koa had taken the dog away.</p>\\r\\n<p>I did not altogether trust Koa, and it made me shudder to think of\\r\\ntaking Azeela outside and perhaps having the dog spring upon us from\\r\\nsomewhere. But we had to chance it, and the woman seemed sincere.</p>\\r\\n<p>We had searched the house as best we could without arousing Bool, but we\\r\\nfound no weapon of any kind. At last we were ready, I in my fur coat,\\r\\nAzeela in furs; shoes, trousers and coat all in one piece. She looked\\r\\nlike a slender little Eskimo girl, and I smiled as she pulled up a fur\\r\\nhood and fitted it close about her face, tucking her hair up under it. I\\r\\nhad been mistaken about headgear; it was just a coincidence that I had\\r\\nnever seen anyone in this time-world wearing a cap.</p>\\r\\n<p>I put on my own cap and we were ready. As we met in the main room, Koa\\r\\nnodded sourly for us to be gone. At that instant the dog, outside in the\\r\\nkennel, gave a long mournful howl. I don\\'t know why; I suppose it was\\r\\njust fate. Koa, waving us toward the doorway, hastened away to quiet the\\r\\ndog.</p>\\r\\n<p>For a moment I hesitated. Should we start? Had the dog gotten loose?\\r\\nThat moment of hesitation was too long. Bool stood in the doorway,\\r\\nstaring at our fur-covered figures. Astonishment, anger, rage swept over\\r\\nhis face. His hand went to his belt; he jerked something loose. I heard\\r\\nAzeela give a sharp cry of warning. Bool\\'s hand held an object like a\\r\\nlittle crescent of glass, with a tiny wire connecting its horns. Sparks\\r\\ndarted from the wire.</p>\\r\\n<p>I was about to leap forward when suddenly I was stricken. I can only\\r\\ndescribe it as paralysis. I stood stock-still; my arms dropped to my\\r\\nsides. I felt no pain, but I was rooted to the spot, without power to\\r\\nlift my legs. Azeela, beside me, was evidently within the influence of\\r\\nthe weapon, also. She was standing rigid. Bool\\'s face held a leer of\\r\\ntriumph. His<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_56\">[Pg 56]</a></span> left hand was fumbling at his belt for some other weapon.\\r\\nI knew that in another moment he would have killed us, and still I could\\r\\nnot move. I tell you, it was a ghastly feeling. There was a numbness\\r\\ncreeping all over me. My hands were turning cold. My feet felt wooden.\\r\\nMy legs were giving way under me, and in a few seconds more I think I\\r\\nshould have fallen.</p>\\r\\n<p>It all happened very quickly. Behind Bool, Koa had appeared. He did not\\r\\nhear her, and she darted forward and struck at his wrist. The little\\r\\ncrescent of glass dropped to the floor and was shattered. A wave of heat\\r\\nswept over me—the blood rushing again to my limbs.</p>\\r\\n<p>Bool had turned furiously upon Koa, but my strength was coming back\\r\\nfast. I jumped at them, caught Bool unprepared. My body struck his and\\r\\nwe went down. He fell backward with me on top of him. His hand now held\\r\\na metal cylinder; he was trying to get it up to my face.</p>\\r\\n<p>Azeela came darting across the room, threw herself upon us, and twisted\\r\\nthe weapon from Bool\\'s fingers. I did not know she had done it. Bool was\\r\\nkicking, squirming, and his left hand had me by the forehead, pushing my\\r\\nhead back to expose my face. Enraged, I flung myself down on him, my\\r\\nforearm striking his head against the floor. His hold relaxed; he lay\\r\\nstill.</p>\\r\\n<p>When I got to my feet, Koa was stooping over Bool. She seemed frightened\\r\\nat what she had done, although I knew well enough that the man had\\r\\nmistreated her constantly, and that she could bear him no great love.\\r\\nShe waved us away, still with that same stolid grimness.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Ask her if the dog is locked up, Azeela,\" I said.</p>\\r\\n<p>The woman nodded at me vehemently, and I gripped Azeela\\'s hand and we\\r\\nhurried out. It was just sunset. The sky was like blood; the snowy\\r\\nground was all tinted with it.</p>\\r\\n<p>We ran west, so fast that Azeela could hardly keep on her feet. I\\r\\nsuppose we went a mile or two, then slowed up and walked a little, then\\r\\nwent back to a run. There was nothing but that unbroken expanse of snow,\\r\\nwith the drop that was the river ahead of us.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_57\">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>At last I could make out the break in the plateau surface that marked\\r\\nthe gully. We were running, and were no more than fifty feet from it,\\r\\nwhen from behind us we heard the loud baying of the dog—that eager\\r\\nbaying of a dog following a trail and closing in on its quarry. I went\\r\\ncold all over. I knew what had happened. Bool had recovered, and, in\\r\\nspite of his daughter, had let the dog loose upon us!</p>\\r\\n<p>I caught a glimpse of Azeela\\'s white, frightened face as I gripped her\\r\\nhand and jerked her forward. It was faster than carrying her. She\\r\\nstumbled, almost fell headlong, but I pulled her up and onward.</p>\\r\\n<p>We came upon the gully. For one agonized instant I wondered if the\\r\\nplane would still be there. The dog seemed almost upon us. I could\\r\\nhear its eager whine as it came leaping along. Then I saw the\\r\\nplane—snow-covered, but undisturbed.</p>\\r\\n<p>We flung ourselves down the gully side, sliding, falling to its bottom.\\r\\nThe deep snow there broke our fall. The dog was at the top; I saw its\\r\\nhuge head and bared fangs as it dashed along, selecting a place to\\r\\ndescend.</p>\\r\\n<p>I jumped to the cabin platform of the plane and shoved open the door.\\r\\nThen I stooped, grasping Azeela under the armpits and lifting her. The\\r\\ndog came sliding into the gully, and gathering itself up, it leaped.</p>\\r\\n<p>But we were inside, and I slid the door closed just as the brute\\'s great\\r\\nbody struck the cabin with an impact that rocked the plane. The dog\\r\\nfell, but was up again with a snarl, standing on its hind legs, its huge\\r\\npaws scratching at the cabin wall.</p>\\r\\n<p>I had flung Azeela to the floor of the compartment. She shouted at me\\r\\nreassuringly, and I jumped to the Frazia controls.</p>\\r\\n<p>A moment later the \\'copters were raising us out of the gully. The dog\\'s\\r\\nbaffled yelps grew fainter. As we rose into the air I saw Bool, a\\r\\nquarter of the way from the house, stumbling along through the snow,\\r\\nfollowing the trail.</p>\\r\\n<p>I went up a thousand feet, dropped a little, and began horizontal\\r\\nflight. To the south, perhaps a mile away, Toroh\\'s<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_58\">[Pg 58]</a></span> sled, with its two\\r\\ndogs, was swinging up toward the house. He saw the plane, and, as we\\r\\nswept over him at an altitude of some five hundred feet, he turned and\\r\\nfollowed us.</p>\\r\\n<p>It was amazing to see those two gigantic dogs run. They kept the sled\\r\\nalmost under us. We came to the south of the island and they went down a\\r\\ndeclivity and out over the frozen, snow-covered water. Toroh was lashing\\r\\nthem with a long whip.</p>\\r\\n<p>I put on more power, and we gradually drew ahead. When we had crossed\\r\\nthe broad expanse of bay, the sled was no more than a black blob in the\\r\\ndistance. It swung to the right, turned and went back—lost to our sight\\r\\nin the gathering darkness.</p>\\r\\n<p>We were alone, headed southward to Azeela\\'s native country.</p>\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 45%;\">\\r\\n<p>Azeela and her people live on an island which once was the mainland—the\\r\\nsoutheastern corner of the United States, as you know it. It\\'s a narrow,\\r\\ncrescent-shaped island, something like Cuba in outline, but smaller.\\r\\nIt\\'s separated from the mainland by a channel some ten miles at its\\r\\ngreatest width. The climate, now, is vastly different from your\\r\\ntime-world. Climate is the most potent factor of all that influences\\r\\nmankind. The change throughout ten thousand years was dramatic in its\\r\\neffects: it hastened decadence, it drove civilization toward the\\r\\nequator. And then, as though nature were bent upon destruction, disease\\r\\nsprang up in the only warm regions left—disease that could not be coped\\r\\nwith. Insects, carrying and transmitting deadly bacteria, swarmed over\\r\\nwhat we call the torrid zone, making it almost uninhabitable. You must\\r\\nrealize over how long a period this went on.</p>\\r\\n<p>Even that was thousands of years before Azeela\\'s birth. This island had\\r\\nformed, and nature had seemed to hold it the one place where humanity\\r\\ncould make its last stand. A volcano stood at each end; beneficent,\\r\\ntreasured because they contained heat. The internal fires of the earth\\r\\nhad broken through here. Hot springs and geysers dotted the land.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_59\">[Pg 59]</a></span> A\\r\\nriver just below the boiling point rose from subterranean depths, flowed\\r\\nfor a hundred miles, and plunged down again. And a huge range of\\r\\nmountains running east and west on the mainland to the north offered\\r\\nshelter from the cold winds that were coming down.</p>\\r\\n<p>Anglo-Saxons with a strain of Latin had settled on this palm-covered,\\r\\ntropical island long before the conditions farther north had become so\\r\\ndrastic. They kept to themselves and fought against the pollution of\\r\\ntheir blood by others; they were descendents of the highest type of\\r\\nEarth civilization.</p>\\r\\n<p>For centuries they were left to themselves, to drift along in their own\\r\\nfashion. But with the coming of the cold, the mixed races of the north\\r\\nbegan moving down—coveting the island. Then these island people\\r\\nsuddenly sprang into activity. Defense of the homeland brought action;\\r\\nlost arts of war were revived. The Anglese—that is as near the sound of\\r\\ntheir word for themselves as I can get—repulsed all comers.</p>\\r\\n<p>To the north was now a climate that held snow from September to June.\\r\\nOnly three brief months availed for agriculture. The mixed peoples there\\r\\ndid not rise to master such rigors. Centuries of struggle turned them\\r\\nalmost primitive, with arts and sciences and ways to conquer their\\r\\nenvironment lost and forgotten. They became barbarians.</p>\\r\\n<p>Such is the condition as I have found it. I can give you details only of\\r\\nour northern half of the western hemisphere. Transportation is back\\r\\nnearly to the primitive; the rest of the world is almost unknown to\\r\\nAzeela\\'s race.</p>\\r\\n<p>Toroh, I\\'ve learned now, is an Anglese, but they banished him. He was\\r\\nplotting to overthrow the government. When he was banished, he went\\r\\namong the barbarians of the north and began organizing them for an\\r\\nattack on the island. Toroh has scientific knowledge; up there in the\\r\\nnorth he has been manufacturing weapons. Then he came back to the island\\r\\nsecretly, and abducted Azeela. She\\'s the daughter of Fahn, the leading\\r\\nscientist of the Anglese—he\\'s the man who holds the reins of power.\\r\\nWith Azeela as hostage, Toroh planned to make Fahn yield.</p>\\r\\n<p>But now that I have released Azeela, Toroh\\'s attack will<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_60\">[Pg 60]</a></span> come swiftly.\\r\\nThat is why I send you this message. Toroh is a menace—the greatest\\r\\nfigure of evil in this time-world. There will be war, a struggle in\\r\\nwhich the Anglese may go down before the onslaught of Toroh and the\\r\\nhordes of barbarians with whom he has allied himself. Oh, I can\\'t tell\\r\\nyou all the details...I\\'m too tired.</p>\\r\\n<p>I\\'ll stop now, and send this message back to you in the cube. And,\\r\\nFather, you know what we arranged—that you would come and join me if I\\r\\nneeded you. Well, I do; I need you here now.</p>\\r\\n<p>As we agreed, I will raise a light-beam signal, which will mark the\\r\\nexact point in space and the exact moment in time at which I want you to\\r\\nbe here.</p>\\r\\n<p>For me, that moment <i>is now</i>!</p>\\r\\n<p>So as soon as I dispatch this message off to you, I shall raise the\\r\\nsignal. It will be at the southeastern tip of our island. For you\\r\\ngeographically, it will be about Miami. From that point in space, you\\r\\ncannot fail to see it, if your time-flight is slow enough. I will hold\\r\\nit in the sky for as long as I can, so that it will have enough duration\\r\\nfor you not to miss it.</p>\\r\\n<p>Please tell <i>Mamita</i> not to worry about me, or about you either. We will\\r\\nboth come back to her safely. You may bring one or two of our friends\\r\\nwho wish to make the trip. I think that George will want to come and I\\r\\nwould like to have him. You need bring no weapons; they would be worse\\r\\nthan useless.</p>\\r\\n<p><i>Please hurry, Father. I need you!</i><span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_61\">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 65%;\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER SIX</h2>\\r\\n<p>Roger\\'s slow, solemn voice died away. He rustled the pages of Loto\\'s\\r\\nmessage in his hand.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"That\\'s all, gentlemen. All of the message itself. The other pages give\\r\\ndetailed instructions—data based on Loto\\'s flight and memoranda for the\\r\\nconstruction of another plane, gathered from previous notes made by Loto\\r\\nand myself.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>There was complete silence when Rogers paused. George decided to speak,\\r\\nbut checked himself and relaxed back in his chair.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I shall start the Frazia Company on another plane at once,\" Rogers\\r\\nadded. \"And working on Loto\\'s mechanism simultaneously, I should be\\r\\nready in ninety days.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He waited, but again no one else spoke. Then he said:</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I am going, of course. It is a great trial for my wife, but I know she\\r\\nis willing.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>George turned and flashed an admiring glance at Lylda; her face was\\r\\nstrained, but she smiled at him gently.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Do not be hasty, my friends,\" Rogers went on quickly. \"Any two of you\\r\\nare free to come—or to stay, all of you—as you think best.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I\\'m going,\" said George suddenly. \"Loto said I could. And you say so.\\r\\nI\\'m going.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He jumped to his feet and grasped Roger\\'s hand. \"You can count on me,\\r\\nMr. Rogers.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Rogers smiled. \"Thank you, George. I knew I could.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>George sat down again. Then he got up and crossed to Lylda, shaking her\\r\\nhand also, and whispering to her. But in another instant he was pacing\\r\\nthe room, smoking violently, and frowning.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_62\">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>Rogers was saying to the others, \"I will take one more. I realize it is\\r\\na momentous question. Your lives may be at stake.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The Big Business Man was deep in reverie. \"I wonder,\" he murmured. \"I\\r\\nwonder if I <i>do</i> want to go.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Come on,\" urged George, stopping suddenly before him. \"Take a chance.\"\\r\\nHe did not wait for an answer, but went back to his pacing.</p>\\r\\n<p>The Banker said, half apologetically. \"You don\\'t really need me, do you,\\r\\nRogers?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Of course not,\" Rogers said heartily. \"Use your own judgement. But I\\r\\nknew you\\'d be offended if I didn\\'t give you the opportunity.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The Banker nodded. \"Yes, but you don\\'t need me. I\\'m an old\\r\\nman—seventy-three, though I hope you\\'d never guess it. I think I\\'d\\r\\nbetter stay where I\\'m used to things.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Of course,\" agreed Rogers.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"But if you need money,\" the Banker added hopefully, \"and you will,\\r\\nnaturally—everybody needs money—you\\'ll call on me, won\\'t you? I\\'m\\r\\ngoing to see this thing through.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I don\\'t believe I\\'ll go,\" the Business Man declared. He met the\\r\\nDoctor\\'s glance, and the Doctor seemed relieved. \"You don\\'t really need\\r\\nus, Rogers. I think Frank would prefer to stay also.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The Doctor nodded emphatic agreement.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Quite so,\" said Rogers. \"I can understand perfectly how you feel.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>George stopped his pacing. \"Then it\\'s all settled, Mr. Rogers. You and I\\r\\ngo; the others stay on guard here. Now listen, everybody, I\\'ve got some\\r\\ngood ideas...\"</p>\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 45%;\">\\r\\n<p>Two days before Christmas, another plane lay glistening on the roof of\\r\\nthe Scientific Club, walled in from curious eyes by the board enclosure.\\r\\nSleek, self-satisfied, its every line denoting latent power, it lay\\r\\nmotionless, awaiting those human masters who soon were to launch it into\\r\\nanother time world.</p>\\r\\n<p>Occasionally during the afternoon George visited it, an<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_63\">[Pg 63]</a></span>xiously\\r\\nverifying again and again that all was in readiness.</p>\\r\\n<p>Evening came. The others arrived, singly and in couples. For two hours a\\r\\nbustle of final preparations went on—things forgotten, last minute\\r\\nplans put into execution. But by nine o\\'clock the moment of departure\\r\\nwas finally at hand.</p>\\r\\n<p>The Banker was in a fluster of excitement. He had appointed himself the\\r\\nleader of those who were to be left behind, and he felt the\\r\\nresponsibility keenly.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Tell me exactly what we\\'ve got to do,\" he insisted. \"I don\\'t want\\r\\nanything to go wrong.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Rogers slapped him on the back. \"It\\'s nothing to be alarmed over.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"No. But I want to be sure I\\'ve got it straight. Tell me all over\\r\\nagain.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Rogers repressed a smile. \"When we have gone you will all wait some ten\\r\\nminutes to be sure nothing has gone wrong to bring us immediately back.\\r\\nThen you will lock up the enclosure and leave. I have made arrangements\\r\\nwith the club to have the enclosure left standing.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"That\\'s all?\" asked the Banker anxiously. \"We leave the roof open?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes. In coming back we will want it open, and you cannot tell when we\\r\\nmay return.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"But no more than six months,\" the Banker insisted. \"You promise that?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Rogers nodded.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Come on,\" George\\'s voice called. \"Let\\'s get started.\" He had shaken\\r\\nhands with Lylda and climbed up to the doorway of the cabin. \"Come on,\\r\\nMr. Rogers. Let\\'s get started.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Lylda stood apart. Her farewell to her husband was brief. The others\\r\\nturned away, feeling that they should not intrude upon it. When Rogers\\r\\njoined George on the platform of the plane, the Doctor was with Lylda,\\r\\ncomforting her.</p>\\r\\n<p>With a final good-by Rogers slid the door closed. The forward\\r\\ncompartment, with its low arch ceiling and its concave walls, was small,\\r\\nbut comfortably equipped. The side windows had upholstered seats running\\r\\nunder them. In front, to the right, were the Frazia controls, a low seat\\r\\nfor<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_64\">[Pg 64]</a></span> the pilot and a small window above the control panel. The time\\r\\ndials and the proton current switch were on the wall to the right. To\\r\\nthe left of the seat was the main entrance door.</p>\\r\\n<p>The division wall between the forward compartment and the engine room\\r\\nbehind it held a small doorway with a sliding door.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Are we ready?\" Rogers asked. \"I think we should be sitting. The shock\\r\\nof departure, new to us, may be more severe than we anticipate.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>His words were calm enough, but they sent a thrill of excitement through\\r\\nGeorge. \"All ready,\" he said. \"Go ahead!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Rogers took a last look about. Then without hesitation, he moved the\\r\\nswitch to the first intensity. To George, the humming seemed very\\r\\ndifferent now than when he had heard it outside the plane. It was no\\r\\nlouder, but it seemed to hum and vibrate inside his body. He was\\r\\nquivering inside, his head began reeling dizzily; then came that\\r\\nsickening, horrible sensation of falling headlong—a vertigo that turned\\r\\neverything to blackness.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Are you all right? We\\'ve started.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>It was Rogers\\'s anxious voice. George opened his eyes; everything seemed\\r\\nglowing, unreal and ghostlike. But he was uninjured, and his head had\\r\\nsteadied.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I\\'m all right,\" he managed to say.</p>\\r\\n<p>The sickness passed quickly. George stood up, steadying himself. \"Gosh,\\r\\nhow light I feel! Queer in the head—don\\'t you? I never imagined—\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He stopped abruptly. Through a side window the fur-coated figure of the\\r\\nBanker was standing against the wall with the others around him. They\\r\\nwere staring toward the plane with an expression that clearly indicated\\r\\nthey could not see it.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"We\\'ve started all right,\" George added. \"Look at them! We\\'re already in\\r\\nfuture time to them. They can\\'t see us!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Suddenly the Banker came forward walking with extraordinary swiftness,\\r\\nand seemingly with little jerks, like a<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_65\">[Pg 65]</a></span> manikin. George held his\\r\\nbreath, for the Banker popped forward, his head and shoulders piercing\\r\\nthe glowing phosphorescent walls and floor of the cabin. He stood\\r\\nmotionless a brief instant, his face close to George\\'s knees. Then, even\\r\\nmore rapidly than he had advanced, he threw a swift glance around and\\r\\nretreated.</p>\\r\\n<p>George recovered himself. \"Boy,\" he said. \"Wasn\\'t that weird though? But\\r\\nwe\\'re all right. I feel fine now.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The droning of the Frazia motors sounded very faintly above the humming.\\r\\nIt was a relief, a help toward normality. The plane was slowly raising\\r\\ninto the air.</p>\\r\\n<p>As it mounted, the roof of the Scientific Club dwindled away below. It\\r\\nwas a dark night, with heavy clouds and a cold wind from the east. The\\r\\ncity, with snow on its rooftops, was sliding eastward beneath them;\\r\\nvague black shadows, dark buildings dotted with lights, and seemingly\\r\\nempty streets.</p>\\r\\n<p>They were still mounting diagonally upward, and carried sidewise by the\\r\\nwind, when the Hudson River slid into view.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Rotten weather, Mr. Rogers,\" George suggested.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes,\" Rogers agreed, \"but that will not bother us for very long. Are\\r\\nyou warm enough?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"One heater is going,\" George responded. \"I\\'ll switch on another.\" He\\r\\nhad familiarized himself thoroughly with the various mechanical\\r\\nappliances of the plane, and he turned a switch that threw current into\\r\\nanother of the small electric radiators.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Anything else?\" he demanded.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"No, I think I shall try the higher intensities of the proton current. I\\r\\nwant our time-progress accelerating as much as possible right from the\\r\\nbeginning.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>George selected a seat hastily.</p>\\r\\n<p>It was not much of an ordeal. The humming seemed to move up a scale to a\\r\\nhigher pitch as Rogers pulled the lever around. The reeling of the\\r\\nsenses came again, but passed almost at once.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"There,\" said Rogers. \"I\\'m glad that\\'s accomplished.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_66\">[Pg 66]</a></span>\"\\r\\n\"We\\'re at the fifteenth intensity—the highest that Loto used.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>George was staring down through the floor window. \"I can see lights down\\r\\nhere. Are you sure it\\'s the highest speed Loto used? He didn\\'t describe\\r\\nit this way.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Our acceleration will pick up over several hours,\" Rogers replied. \"Our\\r\\ntime-progress is still comparatively slow.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The Frazia motors were still droning.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"How high are we, do you suppose?\" George demanded after a moment.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Possibly five thousand feet. We\\'re blowing westward over New Jersey.\\r\\nAnd a little to the south, I think. Soon it will be day.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>His words were anticipated. The scene lighted swiftly. It was day; a\\r\\ndull, cold-looking, cloudy morning. Below them lay New Jersey, almost a\\r\\nnetwork of villages on the fringe of lowlands. A more congested area of\\r\\nbuilding was almost directly beneath and slid under them as they watched\\r\\nit.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Newark!\" exclaimed George. \"And we\\'re into tomorrow. We\\'re making\\r\\nit—we\\'ll soon be with Loto.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>They were up higher than Rogers realized—ten thousand feet, at least.\\r\\nAnd their drift seemed constantly of a more southern trend. It was still\\r\\nuncomfortably cold in the cabin.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Perhaps we should stay at this level,\" Rogers remarked. \"We seem to\\r\\nhave caught a wind from the north.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Night came again in a few moments. Lights dotted the landscape below,\\r\\nbut they were vague, flickering lights. Then day, with sunlight. The\\r\\nwind sudsided. The plane\\'s southern drift was stilled. And then came\\r\\nnight with a moon plunging across the sky, and stars dizzily sweeping\\r\\npast. Then day again, until presently the daylight and the darkness were\\r\\nblended into gray. The drift was permanently passed. In a blending of\\r\\nall the diversified air currents, the plane remained almost stationary.</p>\\r\\n<p>The white, snowy hills of New Jersey soon turned to green. The cabin air\\r\\nwarmed a little. Then autumn and winter came again—and passed in a\\r\\nmoment or two.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_67\">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>Rogers sighed with relief. \"We\\'re fairly started. One year out of\\r\\ntwenty-eight thousand!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"And we\\'ve got eight hundred or a thousand miles of space to travel\\r\\nalso,\" said George. \"We\\'re going to make that simultaneously, aren\\'t\\r\\nwe?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes,\" agreed Rogers.</p>\\r\\n<p>George took a last look through the floor window at the blurring gray\\r\\nlandscape beneath, and stood up to join him. \"Let\\'s talk things over,\"\\r\\nhe suggested. \"I\\'ve got a lot of questions—plans and things.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Rogers had taken a sheaf of script from his pocket.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Loto\\'s notes to guide us,\" he explained. \"I\\'ve followed them closely so\\r\\nfar. We have a flight through time of something more than twenty-five\\r\\nthousand years at the fifteenth intensity, and then we slacken.\\r\\nSimultaneously, we must fly southward some thousand miles or more\\r\\nthrough space, directing our course for the southern tip of Florida.\\r\\nLoto specifies that we should, under all circumstances, reach the\\r\\nlatitude of north Florida coincident with twenty-five thousand years of\\r\\nour time-progress. We will then—or perhaps a thousand years further\\r\\nalong—see the island. We cannot miss it, of course. It is so large, and\\r\\nit must certainly endure over a great period of time.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"How long did Loto take to reach twenty-five thousand years?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"About twelve hours,\" Rogers consulted the memoranda. \"He computes his\\r\\naverage speed as equivalent to the twelfth intensity. We are using the\\r\\nfifteenth continuously. Our clocks should register no more than ten\\r\\nhours for the time-flight.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Ten hours,\" he added thoughtfully. \"And flying directly south at a\\r\\nhundred miles an hour we would reach the island in those ten hours.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"But we haven\\'t started south yet,\" George protested. \"We\\'re moving\\r\\nthrough time all right, but we\\'re still right over Newark—and look at\\r\\nit!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The New Jersey metropolis was spreading west to the Orange Mountains,\\r\\nand eastward it seemed to be linked<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_68\">[Pg 68]</a></span> solid with Jersey City. Factories\\r\\ndotted the intervening meadows, which were drained of their stagnant\\r\\nwater.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You\\'re right,\" exclaimed Rogers. \"We have barely nine hours left; we\\r\\nmust start our horizontal flight.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>In a few moments more they were speeding south and slightly west, at an\\r\\naltitude of some five thousand feet, with their progress through time\\r\\nsteadily accelerating.</p>\\r\\n<p>An hour, by their clocks, had passed. They were over Delaware Bay. Its\\r\\nshores, in the more congested areas, were lined almost solid with\\r\\nbuildings. There was a great city on each side of the mouth of the\\r\\nriver, with a gigantic bridge connecting them. The bridge rose into\\r\\nbeing under the eyes of the watchers in the flying plane, but they swept\\r\\non past and in a moment left it far in the distance behind them.</p>\\r\\n<p>George was seated on the floor watching the changing landscape; a huge,\\r\\nconcave gray surface, shadowless, stretching out and up to the circular\\r\\nhorizon. Steadily, like a panorama unrolled, it slid sidewise beneath\\r\\nthem. The motion was greatest directly below. To the west, the mountains\\r\\nseemed, by an optical illusion, to be following, speeding forward with\\r\\nthem.</p>\\r\\n<p>The sea or its arms constantly occupied a portion of the scene, for they\\r\\nwere still flying south and somewhat west, following the Atlantic coast.\\r\\nAnd of everything in sight, the sea alone seemed unchanging.</p>\\r\\n<p>In time-progressing, that height of civilization Loto had described lay\\r\\nunder them. They were flying lower now.</p>\\r\\n<p>Rogers, in his seat at the controls, said: \"I think we\\'re making it as\\r\\nwe should. That\\'s the four thousand year mark just passed, and we\\'re\\r\\nflying at a hundred and ten miles an hour.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Are you sure we\\'ll hit it right?\" George asked anxiously.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I think so. It\\'s about as Loto figured so far. Those buildings—what a\\r\\ncivilization that must be down there. It will fade presently...in\\r\\nthree or four thousand years.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>George joined him at the forward window. \"Where are we? Are we still\\r\\nover Virginia?\"<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_69\">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes, at least I think we haven\\'t crossed into North Carolina yet. That\\r\\nwas Chesapeake Bay a while ago. Look! That city over there is\\r\\nmelting—going down fast!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The cabin interior was unlighted and dark, except for that\\r\\nphosphorescence with which everything glowed. In their absorption in the\\r\\nscene below, the travelers had forgotten their own curious aspect, until\\r\\nGeorge suddenly remarked:</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Look at us! Ghosts flying through space! Doesn\\'t it make you feel\\r\\nqueer, Mr. Rogers?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The dim cabin interior, with its vague, luminous human figures, did\\r\\nindeed seem unreal. But the unreality was matched now by the scene\\r\\nbeneath; their forward flight through space, combined with a\\r\\ntime-progress now tremendously accelerated, made everything below a\\r\\nshifting, sliding kaleidoscope of changing effects. Details were\\r\\ntransient things, blurred one into the other.</p>\\r\\n<p>The broad fundamentals, however, were obvious. The gray, concave land,\\r\\nridged with mountains, the indented coast line, the gray, changeless\\r\\nsea—all were distinguishable. And overhead the sky was luminous with\\r\\nthe mingled light of sun and moon and a myriad starry worlds, all\\r\\nblended darker by nights of rain and snow and storm.</p>\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 45%;\">\\r\\n<p>They were over North Carolina when Rogers, at the Frazia controls, grew\\r\\ntired. The clock stood at two five. They had been gone some five hours.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I must rest,\" said Rogers. \"George, can you take my place?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>George hesitated. \"I\\'ve flown a bit, but never in a Frazia. I think I\\'d\\r\\nbetter not experiment—not on this flight.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"All right,\" Rogers agreed. \"I\\'ll use the automatic \\'copters for a\\r\\nwhile. Half an hour will rest me up.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>In a few moments they were hovering, seemingly motionless, over North\\r\\nCarolina. Far away to the east, over a bulge in the coast line, they\\r\\ncould just make out Cape Hatteras and the ocean beyond it.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_70\">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>Rogers stretched himself out on one of the leather seats, and lighted a\\r\\ncigar. George sat beside him.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I figure we should be at least halfway to the northern coast of the\\r\\nisland,\" the older man said. \"We have flown some four hundred miles in\\r\\nfour hours.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"But Loto will be waiting at the southeastern tip of the island,\"\\r\\nprotested George. \"That will be easily two or three hundred miles\\r\\nfurther, won\\'t it? I wonder how far along we are in time.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Look at the dials.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>George bent over them. \"About sixty-five hundred years. Some of the\\r\\nhands are going too fast to read.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"More than I had thought,\" commented Rogers.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Do you figure we\\'re still accelerating?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I think we have just about reached our greatest speed,\" Rogers answered\\r\\nslowly. \"Let us see. We\\'ve done an average of thirteen hundred years an\\r\\nhour. We must be progressing at double that now.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>George was figuring on the back of an old envelope. \"Twenty-six hundred\\r\\nan hour. In five more hours at that rate we\\'ll be close to twenty\\r\\nthousand. We can fly down to the north coast of the island easily by\\r\\nthen.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Exactly. We\\'re a little ahead in our space flight. I\\'m glad of it. We\\r\\nshall have to slow our time-progress to almost nothing at the end. We\\r\\nmust take no chances of missing Loto\\'s light signal.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Twenty-six hundred years an hour,\" mused George. \"That\\'s what we\\'re\\r\\nmaking now. Forty-five years a minute. A century almost every two\\r\\nminutes!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The clock had registered thirty minutes more when Rogers declared he was\\r\\nsufficiently rested. At George\\'s suggestion they ate a light meal; then\\r\\nthey started their flight southward again.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"How about looking at the dials now,\" George remarked. \"They were at\\r\\nsixty-five hundred, thirty minutes ago.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Eight thousand,\" Rogers read. \"That\\'s fifteen hundred more. It figures\\r\\nout to three thousand an hour. That\\'s our peak, I think.\"<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_71\">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>The flight now was passing through constantly changing conditions; every\\r\\ntwo minutes the plane was covering some three or four miles of space and\\r\\na century of time. They crossed above North Carolina and came to the\\r\\ncoast again. The cities of the civilization beneath them seemed to be\\r\\nbreaking up. Here and there one stood in its glory; others were mere\\r\\ndeserted piles of ruins over which the vegetation crawled, eager to\\r\\ndevour. Still other cities and villages appeared over the southern\\r\\nhorizon, sturdy and whole—and they melted as they slid beneath the\\r\\nplane, into crumbling piles that passed out of sight to the north.</p>\\r\\n<p>Soon desolate areas appeared. The scene grew vaguely whiter; the snow\\r\\nwas coming down from the north faster than the plane was flying. Changes\\r\\nin the coast line became apparent; unfamiliar arms of the sea swept into\\r\\nview, and were crossed and left behind. A small, unfamiliar island lay\\r\\nclose to the South Carolina coast. But as a whole, the land and sea held\\r\\ntheir own, even against the ravages of so many centuries.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"The north wind is with us—the wind Loto described that blew southward\\r\\nalmost all the year. What time is it?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"By the clock or the dials?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"The clock. I have the dials here. Eighteen thousand four hundred years\\r\\nis their reading.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Quarter of six,\" announced George.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"We should sight the island shortly,\" Rogers said. \"I\\'ll fly a trifle\\r\\nslower. We must be nearly down to Georgia by now—to where Georgia used\\r\\nto be, I should say. I want to sight the island at twenty thousand\\r\\nyears, or thereabouts.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The land was growing white; the vegetation sparser. Small towns and\\r\\nhamlets that endured for no more than fifty or a hundred years were\\r\\nspringing up everywhere, and melting into nothing in a moment or two.\\r\\nThe vegetation was shifting, changing, but always the scene was growing\\r\\nwhiter. The villages were sparser, smaller and shorter lived—the people\\r\\nstruggling southward against the threatening, unrelenting cold, which\\r\\nspared nothing but the island of the Anglese.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_72\">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>Rogers was first to notice a radical departure from the normal\\r\\nconformation of the landscape. They were, by their own calculation, over\\r\\nGeorgia. George, watching the dials closely, had just noted twenty-two\\r\\nthousand years. Far ahead, over the rim of the southwestern horizon, a\\r\\nline of mountains was rising.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Look!\" exclaimed Rogers softly. \"The mountain chain running east and\\r\\nwest. The new mountains! The island must be just beyond them.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He maneuvered the plane into a climb; the gray land and sea tilted and\\r\\nbegan dropping away. The mountains seemed to be following them up,\\r\\nhigher and closer, until at last the plane was over them, barely a\\r\\nthousand feet above their rocky spires.</p>\\r\\n<p>It was a scene of wild grandeur that now spread out beneath their eyes:\\r\\ndark, craggy cliff faces, with snow capped summits, a pure white peak\\r\\nand a gray blue valley beside it. And the whole mass reared ten thousand\\r\\nfeet above the sea.</p>\\r\\n<p>The plane swept forward; the jagged, tumbled land slid northward, close\\r\\nbeneath it. Then, abruptly, the crags and peaks dropped away; it was as\\r\\nthough the plane had leaped ten thousand feet into the air. Far below\\r\\nlay a narrow channel of gray water, stretching east and west. And beyond\\r\\nthat lay another land, its outer coast curving to the south.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"<i>The island!</i>\" exclaimed Rogers softly. \"What a cataclysm was here—a\\r\\nrift that let the sea in and buckled up the mountains!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"The island!\" echoed George. \"And we\\'re at twenty-three thousand five\\r\\nhundred years! We\\'ve some distance yet to fly,\" he warned. \"Hadn\\'t we\\r\\nbetter slacken our time progress?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>With their flight through space temporarily checked, the \\'copters\\r\\nholding them motionless, Rogers cut down the proton current to the fifth\\r\\nintensity. Eagerly they looked below them.</p>\\r\\n<p>Beyond the channel lay the island, curving up in an arc from the south\\r\\nand out to the west. They could not see<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_73\">[Pg 73]</a></span> across it, but only to a ridge\\r\\nof mountains at its center. Huge palms grew everywhere, and the\\r\\nshoreline formed a broad, curving beach of white sand. An island\\r\\nparadise—though their time progress still laid a gray cast over the\\r\\ngreen, blurred the water into a formless haze along the beach and\\r\\nshifted the vegetation into a confusion of changing forms.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"We must get started,\" Rogers said at last. \"At twenty-eight thousand\\r\\nyears we must be within sight of the southern tip.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>It was a flight almost due south. Lakes occasionally were visible, and\\r\\ntwo or three small rivers, one of which changed its course suddenly\\r\\nunder their eyes; and everywhere that tropical verdure, mounting and\\r\\nmelting, always shifting with its rapid growth and decay.</p>\\r\\n<p>In some three hours more—with another longer rest for Rogers, during\\r\\nwhich time the \\'copters held them poised motionless—they sighted the\\r\\nsouthern tip of the island. It had narrowed here to a point no more than\\r\\ntwo miles wide, ending with a curving beach and the broad, empty ocean\\r\\nbeyond; a beach with a palm-covered mountain slope close behind it.</p>\\r\\n<p>Rogers had made several changes of time progress during the latter part\\r\\nof the trip, and they were poised over the sea near the tip of the\\r\\nisland for no more than a few moments when the dials recorded\\r\\ntwenty-eight thousand two hundred years.</p>\\r\\n<p>Rogers consulted Loto\\'s notes. \"He landed in this time world at\\r\\ntwenty-eight thousand two hundred and four years. We must stop at the\\r\\nbeginning of that year and watch for his light.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Using the fourth intensity, the daylight and darkness was separated into\\r\\ntwo brief, but distinguishable periods. Thus the voyagers sped through\\r\\nthe days and nights, the weeks and months and forward into another year.\\r\\nAt the beginning of the fourth year, Rogers changed to the third\\r\\nintensity. It was daylight—a yellow-red, swiftly mounting sun; flying\\r\\nblurs of white clouds close overhead; a blue sea, and a bright green\\r\\nisland.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_74\">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>The sun plunged across the sky and sank blood red, with an instant of\\r\\nglorious colors suffusing the western sky. Night came, with its deep,\\r\\npurple mystery. Then day again.</p>\\r\\n<p>Thus the days of that fourth year went by; each hardly a minute long,\\r\\nbut slow to the two men so anxiously watching. They were tired to the\\r\\npoint of exhaustion, but the excitement and anxiety kept them going.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"He said from the tip of the island,\" Rogers murmured. \"A blue-white,\\r\\nvertical beam of light shining for a day and a night...we couldn\\'t\\r\\nmiss it. A minute would show it to us plainly.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I haven\\'t taken my eyes off that island for a second,\" commented George\\r\\nfrom his seat on the floor. \"Why doesn\\'t he hurry up? He\\'s down there,\\r\\nwhy doesn\\'t he give us the signal?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Rogers did not answer. The sun dropped below the horizon. The turning\\r\\nworld, with its motion made so visible, was dizzying to one who watched\\r\\nthe sky.</p>\\r\\n<p>The purple night was momentarily colored with a red moon; it rose and\\r\\nswiftly plunged into a thick bank of clouds that swept down upon it.</p>\\r\\n<p>Abruptly, from the tip of the island, a shaft of blue-white light shot\\r\\ninto the sky. It wavered an instant, then stood motionless: <i>clear</i>,\\r\\n<i>distinct</i>, <i>unmistakable</i>!</p>\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 65%;\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER SEVEN</h2>\\r\\n<p>The proton current had been entirely cut off. The interior of the cabin\\r\\nwas solid in appearance once more. The Frazia motors were still droning\\r\\nand the plane hung motionless in a night that was without wind. Below\\r\\nit, now, lay a scene<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_75\">[Pg 75]</a></span> of complete normality: the sea was rolling up on\\r\\nthe white sand and the moon, almost at its zenith, bathed the green\\r\\nisland in a silvery, red-tinged light. And from the tip of the island,\\r\\nquite near its southern branch, Loto\\'s narrow beam of blue-white light\\r\\nwas flashing upward into the sky.</p>\\r\\n<p>They descended, in a gentle glide. The beach was broad and firm; they\\r\\nlanded upon it, swooping along. It was like racing an automobile along\\r\\nthe sand in the moonlight, with the ocean on one side—far out at low\\r\\ntide now—and a jungle of green, tropical vegetation on the other.</p>\\r\\n<p>Rogers, at the controls, saw a number of human figures standing on the\\r\\nbeach ahead of him. They scattered hastily, and the plane, rapidly\\r\\nlosing velocity, went past them and stopped a hundred yards farther.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"<i>We\\'re here!</i>\" George cried. \"Let\\'s get out. Was that Loto we passed?\\r\\nWhere\\'s the light? Are we near it?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The light could be seen no more than a hundred feet away among the\\r\\npalms. They climbed hastily from the plane. A figure was coming forward\\r\\nalong the beach at a run; a slight figure in wide trousers of white\\r\\ncloth, and a short, flapping jacket.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Loto!\" shouted George. \"That you, Loto?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>From a distance came a faint, \"Hello-o... George!\" The runner increased\\r\\nhis speed. It was Loto.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Well,\" he exclaimed, as he shook their hands. \"You got here right away,\\r\\ndidn\\'t you? I\\'ve only had that light up two or three hours.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"We\\'re tired out,\" said Rogers, when the greetings were over. \"Do we\\r\\nstay in the plane or can we leave it?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>A man was standing fearfully at the edge of the green jungle nearby, and\\r\\nLoto called him forward. He was dressed in wide trousers, like Loto\\'s\\r\\nexcept that they were smeared with dirt and sand, and his feet and torso\\r\\nwere bare. He came, timidly, and Loto spoke to him apart. The man nodded\\r\\nhis head, indicating that he understood his orders. Then he trotted\\r\\naway, joining three or four others of his kind, gesticulating toward the\\r\\nplane. They all approached it reluctantly.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_76\">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>George plucked at the flaring sleeve of Loto\\'s short jacket, his only\\r\\ngarment above the waist. \"How\\'s Azeela, Loto? Is she...is everything\\r\\nall right?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes, she\\'s all right. But I needed you and father here. Wait! Not now.\\r\\nI\\'ll tell you later.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Rogers joined them. \"We\\'re about exhausted, Loto. We must have some\\r\\nsleep.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes, of course. I knew you\\'d be. I\\'ve a house near here—only a hundred\\r\\nyards or so. They\\'ll guard the plane.\" His gesture indicated the men who\\r\\nwere now on the sand, moving about the plane, but evidently afraid to\\r\\ntouch it.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You can trust them?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Implicitly.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>They followed Loto. George was tired, but so excited that he did not\\r\\nrealize it. The night air was warm and heavy with moisture. It was\\r\\noppressive; it reminded him somehow of the steam room of a Turkish bath.\\r\\nHe found himself perspiring.</p>\\r\\n<p>They left the moonlit beach and, following a tiny, white-sand path,\\r\\nplunged into the depths of the jungle. Palms of every variety stood\\r\\nabout, their graceful fronds interlacing overhead. There were huge trees\\r\\nloaded with fruit, bananas, mangoes, grapefruit. Some of the other fruit\\r\\ntrees George dimly remembered having heard of but could not name, and\\r\\nstill others he was sure were entirely new.</p>\\r\\n<p>It was dark in the jungle here, and very silent. The steamy air was\\r\\nredolent with perfume—orange blossoms, George thought. The light signal\\r\\nwas nowhere to be seen. George wondered if it had burned out, or if Loto\\r\\nhad ordered those men to extinguish it.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Here we are,\" said Loto abruptly.</p>\\r\\n<p>A house was standing at their right, in an open space with the moonlight\\r\\ngleaming on it—a large, tropical-looking bungalow. There was a broad\\r\\nveranda on three sides, with windows opening into the house. The house\\r\\nitself was raised some four feet off the ground on coconut posts, and a\\r\\nbrown-thatched roof spread over everything like a mound.</p>\\r\\n<p>It seemed to be a house that would have ten rooms, at<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_77\">[Pg 77]</a></span> least. George\\r\\nwondered what made it look so peculiar. Then he realized that its board\\r\\nwalls were not vertical, but sloped inward toward the top, so that its\\r\\nrooms would be smaller at the ceiling than the floor. It looked like a\\r\\nhouse of cards.</p>\\r\\n<p>Loto had turned into another path. A brown picket fence enclosed the\\r\\nhouse with perhaps an acre of ground. Inside was a flower garden, abloom\\r\\nwith an extraordinary profusion of flowers.</p>\\r\\n<p>A short flight of wooden steps led to the veranda. There Loto stopped.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I think we should retire at once,\" Rogers said. \"We have so much to\\r\\ntalk of—but it will wait.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes,\" Loto agreed. \"Come with me, Father. George, you stay here. I\\'ll\\r\\nbe right out.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>George sat down on the veranda, with his back against a round palm trunk\\r\\nthat was supporting its roof. He realized now how tired he was, and this\\r\\nheavy air made him sleepy, he heard the others moving away, entering the\\r\\nhouse. He took off his coat, then his shirt and, using them for a\\r\\npillow, stretched himself out at full length on the board flooring of\\r\\nthe veranda.</p>\\r\\n<p>In a moment, when Loto returned to take him to the room they were to\\r\\noccupy together, he found George sleeping peacefully.</p>\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 45%;\">\\r\\n<p>George awakened with the morning sun streaming through a window. He was\\r\\non a broad couch, and in a chair beside him, Loto was reclining\\r\\ncomfortably, smoking his black brier pipe. He smiled.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Oh, you\\'re awake, are you? You ought to be—it\\'s hours after sunrise.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>A vague memory of being taken into the house by Loto the night before\\r\\ndrifted back to George. He remembered being half-asleep and talking to\\r\\nhis friend, but it was all like a dream.</p>\\r\\n<p>The room was small, queer-looking, with its walls sloping together\\r\\ntoward the ceiling. But it was bright and clean, with brown fibre\\r\\nmatting on the floor.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_78\">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>The air was as moist and heavy as ever, and even warmer. George sat up,\\r\\nmopping his forehead with his shirt sleeve.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I\\'ve got your clothes,\" Loto said, indicating a stool with garments\\r\\nlying on it. \"You don\\'t need much in this heat. Get up and try them on.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>George was presently arrayed, like Loto, in low, tight slippers of soft\\r\\nhide—clipped dog-skin, Loto told him—with trousers of white material,\\r\\nbulging above the knees and tight at the ankles, and a brown and green\\r\\ncloth jacket, ornamented with little metal coins. The jacket was\\r\\nsquare-cut and short; it just covered the waist-band of the trousers in\\r\\nback. It was lined with something soft, thin and yet absorbent; it felt\\r\\nsmooth and comfortable next to George\\'s skin. But it would not meet in\\r\\nfront; it left his chest and stomach bare. He stood regarding it\\r\\nruefully until Loto showed him how to fasten it closed across his\\r\\nstomach.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Nice and cool—when you get used to it,\" George commented, staring down\\r\\nat his exposed chest. \"How do I look? Kind of queer, don\\'t I?\" He\\r\\ntwisted himself around, trying to see down over the side bulge of his\\r\\ntrousers.</p>\\r\\n<p>Roger\\'s voice, calling, interrupted them.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I\\'ve got a million things to talk to you about,\" George was telling\\r\\nLoto. \"Hurry it up—I\\'ll be out in the garden.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>They met, a few minutes later, on the side veranda where they were to\\r\\nhave breakfast. George\\'s self-consciousness vanished immediately; Rogers\\r\\nwas dressed almost exactly as he was, and he flattered himself he looked\\r\\nat least as well as his companion.</p>\\r\\n<p>It seemed to the new arrivals, at this first glance, a primitive world\\r\\nindeed into which they had fallen, the heat, the palms, the thatched\\r\\nbungalow, and their costumes all might have existed in some\\r\\nout-of-the-way tropical land of their own time-world.</p>\\r\\n<p>During the meal George was insistent with questions, but Loto smilingly\\r\\nrefused to talk. Instead, he led his father into a brief description of\\r\\ntheir flight forward through time and south through space. When the meal\\r\\nwas over Loto took them out to the front veranda.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_79\">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>\"I\\'ve a great deal to tell you,\" he said, \"and I know you\\'re as\\r\\nimpatient to hear it as I am to tell you. I\\'ve been here on the island\\r\\nfive months—\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"We realize it,\" George murmured. \"Didn\\'t I watch for that light through\\r\\nevery day and night of \\'em?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Loto smiled. \"I put the signal up last night because I felt that I\\r\\nneeded you. Before we do anything, I must tell you of our affairs here.\\r\\nYou notice I say \\'our affairs.\\' They are a part of me now. I don\\'t\\r\\nexactly know why, but the thing here grips me. I want to help these\\r\\npeople... I feel already that I am one of them.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>It was no mystery to George.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Where\\'s Azeela?\" he demanded with apparent irrelevancy.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"In Anglese City, the capital and largest center of population on the\\r\\nisland. It\\'s north of here—on the channel. I\\'ve been living there; I\\r\\ncame down here merely to meet you. The situation here is drastic,\\r\\nFather. War has been impending, and now it will not be postponed much\\r\\nlonger. This Toroh—as I told you, he is an Anglese renegade—is\\r\\norganizing the barbarians of the north, the Noths, as they are called.\\r\\nThey are a people of low intelligence—brutes of men with thick black\\r\\nhair on their bodies.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"God knows how many Noths there are—hordes of them are scattered about\\r\\nthe northern wastes. Toroh has been organizing them. He has a base up\\r\\nnorth where he is manufacturing scientific weapons. There is class\\r\\nhatred here on the island, but, thank Heaven, in the face of an outside\\r\\ninvasion, the Anglese will stick together.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You\\'re preparing for war,\" George interposed. \"You—\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes, of course. The Anglese have had no warfare for several\\r\\ngenerations; they were totally unprepared, but now they\\'re getting\\r\\nthings in shape.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Loto\\'s tone was optimistic, but the anxiety of his expression belied it.\\r\\n\"I wanted you here, Father—you and George. Without Toroh, we would not\\r\\nfear the Noths. But Toroh is a scientist, and what weapons he will have\\r\\nbeen able to manufacture we do not know. We can only—\"<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_80\">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>A man came dashing up the garden path; a man in the familiar wide\\r\\ntrousers, torn and dirty. His red-brown, naked torso gleamed with sweat;\\r\\na white cloth was tied about his forehead to keep the damp hair from his\\r\\neyes.</p>\\r\\n<p>Loto leaped to his feet, and the man, gazing at the strangers with one\\r\\nswift, surprised glance, flung himself prostrate on the steps.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"What—\" began Rogers.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Wait! A messenger from Azeela. Something has gone wrong.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Loto raised the man up, and listened to his flood of frightened words\\r\\nwith obvious concern. A sharp question from Loto, a crisp order, and the\\r\\nmessenger was dashing away. Loto\\'s gaze, following him, came back to his\\r\\ncompanions on the porch.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Bad news, Father. We must get up to Anglese City at once. Spies have\\r\\nappeared in Orleen—a city at the western end of the island—spies from\\r\\nToroh, former Anglese, banished like himself. They\\'re being put to death\\r\\nas fast as they can be caught. But meanwhile they\\'re talking to the\\r\\nlower class—telling the people that Toroh is for them, and only against\\r\\ntheir government. There is class hatred here. The people are listening\\r\\nto the emissaries. We may be facing a revolution—an internal break—on\\r\\nthe eve of fighting the Noths! We will lose if that happens—<i>lose to\\r\\nToroh inevitably</i>!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>They were down on the beach in five minutes more. The plane stood there,\\r\\nundisturbed. Half a dozen figures rose from the sand beside it and stood\\r\\nrespectfully waiting for Loto to approach.</p>\\r\\n<p>Rogers took his seat beside the Frazia controls. They were presently in\\r\\nthe air, flying northward over the palm-covered island that lay calm,\\r\\nserene in its false security and peacefulness.</p>\\r\\n<p>Loto sat close to his father, with George beside them.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I must tell you briefly the conditions here,\" Loto said. \"Then you will\\r\\nbe able to understand—be able to help with your advice and judgement as\\r\\nwell as actions.\"<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_81\">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>He spoke briskly but carefully, and his manner regained its poise.\\r\\nGeorge was gazing down through one of the side windows.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"That\\'s Azeela\\'s messenger,\" Loto commented, \"going back to Anglese\\r\\nCity.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>They were flying hardly five hundred feet above the palms. A white road\\r\\nlay beneath them; along it a huge, shaggy dog was running, with the\\r\\nfigure of a man on its back. The dog\\'s neck was stretched forward, its\\r\\nbody low to the ground as it ran with almost incredible speed, the man\\r\\nlashing its flanks with a leather thong. The plane passed very slowly\\r\\nand drew away.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"We will not land in the heart of the city,\" Loto added. \"He\\'ll be with\\r\\nAzeela before we are.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Go on and tell us about things,\" George urged. \"We\\'ve got the time now;\\r\\nmaybe we won\\'t have it later.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Loto nodded. \"I will. We have here on the island three social classes.\\r\\nHow they developed throughout the centuries you will have to imagine for\\r\\nyourself. Ancient, almost prehistoric Egypt was no more than a quarter\\r\\nas far into the past of our time-world as we are now ahead of it.\\r\\nConsidered in that light, the changes have been rather less radical than\\r\\nyou would anticipate.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"The lowest class—you would call them peons in our old Latin\\r\\nAmerica—are now termed the Bas. They include more than nine-tenths of\\r\\nall the inhabitants of the island. Most of them are ignorant,\\r\\nuneducated; yet they include, also, many intelligent, learned\\r\\nindividuals.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"It is the lowest class which is now plunged into almost intolerable\\r\\nconditions. They are the workers. Through generations of working in the\\r\\nsun, their skin has become a reddish brown. The higher class—the\\r\\nnobility—are the Arans. As the governing class, the Arans live for the\\r\\nmost part in idleness and luxury, while the Bas are held down to almost\\r\\nuniversal poverty.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You haven\\'t seen the Arans yet. We will be in their chief city shortly.\\r\\nYou will find them white-skinned, their women especially, for they\\r\\nshield themselves carefully from<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_82\">[Pg 82]</a></span> the sun. They are cultured, yet\\r\\nwithout great learning. Can you appreciate that condition? They\\'re the\\r\\nones who really show the decadence of this time-world.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Is there a third class?\" Rogers prompted.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes. The Scientists—to me the most interesting of all. You will\\r\\nappreciate that in long past ages, science was supreme. In war it was\\r\\neverything. The Anglese came to this island and grew apathetic, but the\\r\\nScientists, in some measure, clung to their learning. Gradually, their\\r\\nattitude must have changed to secrecy. They became a sect, holding\\r\\nknowledge for its own sake, keeping it among themselves.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"The real power lay with them, and they knew it. But curiously enough,\\r\\ntheir science seemed all-sufficient. As a body, they never desired\\r\\ngoverning power; no individual rose among them with a yearning for\\r\\nconquest—except Toroh.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Foreign wars came. The Scientists offered their help, and when the wars\\r\\nwere over, retired with their knowledge to themselves. The sect, as you\\r\\nwill find it today, is on the downgrade. It has dwindled to a thousand\\r\\nor two individuals who are scattered throughout the island. They call\\r\\nthemselves the League—I should say, a word that means about that. They\\r\\nhave their own officers; a council of a hundred in Anglese City, and a\\r\\nlifetime president, Fahn, Azeela\\'s father.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Thus, you understand, the League of Scientists really controls\\r\\neverything. But its members are content with the prestige their position\\r\\ngives them. The government itself has for centuries fostered this\\r\\nsecrecy of all that pertains to science. In times of war, the Arans are\\r\\nhelpless, and leave it all to the League. In times of peace they forget\\r\\nthe possibility of war and go back to ruling the Bas in their own\\r\\nfashion.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Loto glanced out one of the windows. \"Look down there.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The island was mountainous; a constant succession of green hills and\\r\\nvalleys. A small lake came into view, with steam rising from it.\\r\\nEverywhere the scene was dotted with thatched huts and, occasionally, a\\r\\nmore pretentious bunga<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_83\">[Pg 83]</a></span>low like the one in which the visitors had passed\\r\\nthe previous night. As they flew low over the hills, they could see\\r\\nsmall brown and white patches of cultivated land scattered everywhere.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"That is the way the Bas live,\" Loto commented. \"Sometimes they bring\\r\\ntheir produce to the cities and sell it for ridiculously small sums. If\\r\\nthere\\'s a food shortage, the Arans come out and take it—paying for it\\r\\nnominally.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"But their factories, their industries?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"In the cities, Father. Reduced to a minimum, and for the use and\\r\\nwelfare of the Arans and Scientists almost exclusively. Skilled labor is\\r\\nperformed by the higher types of the Bas. They are allowed to live in\\r\\nthe cities, but are paid so little that they must live unpretentiously.\\r\\nEverything is done for the welfare of the Arans and the League of\\r\\nScientists.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"And the government?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"A monarchy. A king, his council of fifty and his personal cabinet of\\r\\nfive. A hereditary monarch, wholly inefficient, except in forcing his\\r\\nlaws upon the Bas.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I should think that would be somewhat difficult,\" Rogers commented.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"There is a large police force made up of swaggering young men of the\\r\\nArans. They serve for the joy of it; they\\'re mostly arrogant individuals\\r\\nwho take pleasure in the enforcement of the personal power they hold.\\r\\nAnd they abuse it, of course. Their task is easy, for they have the\\r\\nScientists behind them. If one of them were killed, or even attacked by\\r\\na Bas, it would mean the death of that Bas and all his family.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I said the Bas were under conditions almost intolerable. And that\\'s\\r\\nexactly why these spies of Toroh\\'s are dangerous to us just now. The\\r\\nwhole social condition here is wretched, but, I suppose, logical enough\\r\\nunder the circumstances of environment and racial development.\\r\\nFundamentally, the difficulty has been a limited land area. The race\\r\\ncannot expand, hence numerically it must be restrained.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"How?\" demanded Rogers. \"By birth control?\"<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_84\">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>\"Obligatory birth control—applicable only to the Bas. More Bas are not\\r\\ndesired, hence births are limited. The desire just now—more than to\\r\\nhold the population even—is to cut it down. Hence, a Bas woman is\\r\\nallowed only two offspring.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"But suppose she has three?\" George suggested.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"The mother and her child—illegitimate in a new sense—are banished\\r\\nfrom the island.\" Loto\\'s voice rose to sudden vehemence. \"Can you\\r\\nunderstand what that sometimes does? I have seen a mother with her\\r\\nnewborn infant, two or three weeks old, pleading before the King\\'s\\r\\nCouncil. She would not murder it at birth, as the Bas women sometimes\\r\\ndo, and I saw her plead for its right to live on the island. And then,\\r\\nwith her plea denied, she took it away into the frozen north. Her\\r\\nhusband did not follow her. That is optional. This one stayed behind,\\r\\nkeeping the other two children, and letting her take the infant alone.\\r\\nAnd she went, to save its life—her child, born without a birthright.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>There was a silence. Rogers was staring down at a hilltop where, as the\\r\\nplane swept past, a woman with two naked children at her side stood in\\r\\nfront of a small shack.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"And when you have seen the Arans, living their life of luxury and\\r\\nimmorality,\" Loto went on, \"you will wonder why the Bas have stood it so\\r\\nlong. \\'After us—the deluge,\\' has always been the Aran reasoning.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The plane was climbing to pass over a jagged, volcanic-looking peak.\\r\\nBehind, nestled in a hollow, with a curving stretch of white sand and\\r\\nthe blue waters of the channel beyond, lay the capital city of the\\r\\nArans: reckless, pleasure-loving, secure in its beauty and supremacy,\\r\\nyet trembling from so many causes upon the brink of disaster.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_85\">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 65%;\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER EIGHT</h2>\\r\\n<p>On the gently undulating floor of a valley, surrounded by three\\r\\nmountains and with the sea rolling up on its beach to the north, lay the\\r\\nAran city. From an altitude of some three thousand feet, the travelers\\r\\ngazed down upon a scene of extraordinary color and beauty: low, pure,\\r\\nwhite buildings with many balconies and patios; gardens of vivid\\r\\nflowers; white pergolas trellised with scarlet blossoms; sunken pools of\\r\\nlimpid water, with huge date palms curving over them. A grove of royal\\r\\npalms grew close to the beach, near a huge, rectangular bathing pool and\\r\\na marble-white pavilion. A white palace stood on a rise of ground with a\\r\\nbalconied tower, five hundred feet high, beside it. On the top of the\\r\\ntower was a beautiful flower garden. And everywhere was the romantic\\r\\ngreen foliage of the tropics, the blue-red sky, the soft, red-white\\r\\nclouds, and the azure waters of the channel.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Where do we land?\" George asked.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"To the west a little, Father,\" Loto directed. \"See the cavern\\r\\nentrance?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He pointed for George, explaining: \"We will not land directly in the\\r\\ncity. I want the plane permanently guarded now, so we will leave it in\\r\\nthe Cavern of Thunderbolts.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"The what?\" George demanded.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"That\\'s what the Bas picturesquely call it. You see the cavern mouth?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Across the city, a yawning black hole gaped in the mountainside near its\\r\\nbase; an opening of irregularly circular shape, some two hundred feet in\\r\\ndiameter. A gentle slope led up to it from the city.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_86\">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>\"We can fly directly in,\" Loto added. \"It\\'s the entrance to the\\r\\nsubterranean chambers where the scientists work—and where they store\\r\\ntheir apparatus under guard. It\\'s also a museum, where relics of the\\r\\npast are gathered.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>George relapsed into an awed silence, staring down at the city. In the\\r\\nstreets and on the housetops, people were standing, gazing up at the\\r\\nplane curiously.</p>\\r\\n<p>The mouth of the cavern grew steadily larger as the plane swooped down\\r\\nupon it. The yawning hole seemed to have a level floor extending\\r\\nhorizontally back into the mountain. Far back into the darkness, little\\r\\nblue lights twinkled.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You\\'d better take the controls, Loto,\" Rogers said anxiously. \"I don\\'t\\r\\nlike the idea of flying into that.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Loto slipped quietly into the seat. The Frazia motors stopped abruptly.\\r\\nSilently, with only the sound of the air rushing past, the plane glided\\r\\nswiftly downward.</p>\\r\\n<p>Around the cavern mouth was a small platform with a roof over it, built\\r\\non an overhanging ledge of rock. The figures of three men seated there\\r\\nwere visible. Abruptly one of the men rose, and from his upflung hand a\\r\\ntiny flash of blue-white light shot into the clouds overhead. Even in\\r\\nthe daylight it was a plainly visible flash.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Lightning!\" George exclaimed and, as though to confirm him, a little\\r\\nminiature crack of thunder sounded an instant later.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"They know I\\'m coming,\" Loto said.</p>\\r\\n<p>It was a queer sensation, darting into that blackness. The cave mouth\\r\\nseemed to open and swallow them. The plane struck the ground with a\\r\\nbump, lifted, bumped again and rolled forward. Points of light swept\\r\\npast on either side; a blue-white glare lay ahead.</p>\\r\\n<p>The plane slackened its speed and came to a stop.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"We\\'re here,\" said Loto. \"Take only what you will need at once. We can\\r\\ncome back here later today or tomorrow.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Quickly, they descended from the plane.</p>\\r\\n<p>The hum of dynamos sounded from far away in the mountain\\'s depths. The\\r\\nroof high overhead was dimly visible, and great shadows, flickering\\r\\nblue-white lights, were everywhere.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_87\">[Pg 87]</a></span> Near at hand, where the cave\\r\\nbroadened, was a space more brightly lighted. Further along it narrowed\\r\\nagain, forming a dozen branching passages. An incline fifty feet wide\\r\\nsloped down into blackness, with a faint pencil-point of blue light\\r\\nshining from far down within its recesses.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Why, the whole mountain is honeycombed!\" Rogers exclaimed.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes, sir. Just stand here a minute and I\\'ll be with you. Don\\'t move\\r\\nabout!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Figures were approaching, robed in black rubber garments, gloved and\\r\\nhooded. Loto turned to greet them, and they drew back their hoods,\\r\\ndisclosing their heads and faces. There was a brief conversation, then\\r\\nLoto turned back to his companions.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Fahn is at home in the city,\" he said swiftly, and his tone was\\r\\nconcerned. \"We\\'ll go there.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The black-robed figures gazed at them curiously a moment; then went back\\r\\nto their work. Led by Loto, the three started off toward the mouth of\\r\\nthe cave.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Is your plane in here, Loto?\" Rogers asked.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"No, sir. I left it at Orleen. There\\'s a cavern there similar to this,\\r\\nbut smaller. It\\'s there—in the other cavern.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You\\'re sure it\\'s safe?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Of course.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Where are we going?\" George demanded after a moment.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"To Fahn\\'s home,\" Loto answered. \"He\\'ll be there with Azeela and\\r\\nDianne.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Dianne?\" George\\'s voice took on a new note of interest. \"Who is she?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Azeela\\'s younger sister,\" Loto explained briefly. He smiled. \"I meant\\r\\nto tell you about her, George. She\\'s a little daredevil—you\\'ll like\\r\\nher.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>George just smiled, and for some time they walked on in silence. The\\r\\nground was wet, like muddy clay. There were no lights ahead, but the\\r\\ndaylight from the cave\\'s mouth lighted their way.</p>\\r\\n<p>They emerged from the cave and came out onto a road<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_88\">[Pg 88]</a></span> of white sand and\\r\\nclay that led down the mountain slope. Palms lined it thickly. Further\\r\\ndown, at the bottom of the quarter-mile descent, houses began; the\\r\\noutskirts of the city. The road soon took on the aspect of a street. It\\r\\nwas broad, with narrow pedestrian paths on both sides. Flower gardens,\\r\\noften with hedges of thick, bayonet-like plants, lined the walks. The\\r\\nhouses were for the most part almost obscured by palms and trellised\\r\\nvines that were laden with scarlet blossoms. Private, outdoor bathing\\r\\npools occasionally showed through the garden foliage.</p>\\r\\n<p>It was obviously a residential section. As the party advanced,\\r\\npassers-by grew more numerous. The Bas men were distinguishable by their\\r\\nclipped, bullet-like heads, covered with broad, circular-brimmed hats of\\r\\nstraw; their sun-tanned bodies naked above the waist, bare feet, and the\\r\\nwide trousers. The Bas women, also red-brown of skin, were usually\\r\\nclothed merely with a loin cloth and a white sash bound over the\\r\\nbreasts, their hair twisted in plaits hanging down the back.</p>\\r\\n<p>The Bas walked always in the road itself. On the pedestrian paths, a few\\r\\nArans passed by; men with long hair to the base of the neck, and dressed\\r\\nsomewhat as Loto had garbed his father and friend. Most of them saluted\\r\\nLoto—a queer, flowing gesture of the left hand—and all of them stared\\r\\nwith frank curiosity at the strangers. Occasionally an Aran woman came\\r\\nalong—white-swathed, mysterious figures; a twinkle of tiny,\\r\\nblack-slippered feet, a flash from alluring eyes veiled by lashes\\r\\nheavily darkened.</p>\\r\\n<p>An Aran man riding a dog went slowly down a side street. A dog pulling a\\r\\nsmall, three-wheeled cart piled high with merchandise passed in the\\r\\nopposite direction.</p>\\r\\n<p>George edged toward Loto. \"Those dogs,\" he whispered. \"They\\'re friendly?\\r\\nNot vicious?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Of course not,\" Loto laughed. \"Just like regular dogs. Except...well,\\r\\nI\\'ll tell you later.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>George sighed with relief. \"All right. But they\\'re not like any dogs I\\r\\never saw at home—they\\'re nearly as big as a horse. And there\\'s\\r\\nsomething else wrong about them—they\\'re<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_89\">[Pg 89]</a></span> too intelligent. You can see\\r\\nthat just by looking at them walk.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Presently they turned into the gateway of a hedge solid with white and\\r\\nscarlet blossoms.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Fahn\\'s home,\" Loto said. \"We\\'ll go right in.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>They passed through a garden, colorful with its mass of vivid flowers,\\r\\nand heavy with the languorous scent of magnolia and orange blossoms. The\\r\\nhouse stood well back from the road. It was a low, broad building, white\\r\\nin color, with, a low-hanging room—not thatched, but seemingly of blue\\r\\ntiling.</p>\\r\\n<p>Then they were on the veranda. The walls of the house sloped inward at\\r\\nthe top. There was a window nearby—no glass—with a blue-white, silky\\r\\ncurtain shrouding it. The door stood open; inside was a hall, with\\r\\nanother door open to the sunlight of a patio banked with flowers.</p>\\r\\n<p>A girl came to the doorway. It was Azeela. George recognized her at\\r\\nonce: a slight little creature of blue eyes, golden hair and milk-white\\r\\nskin; a pale blue sash wound wide about her hips and thighs,\\r\\nbreastplates of metal, with the broad, circular collar above them, and\\r\\nher hair parted forward over her shoulders in plaits that ended with\\r\\nlittle tassels. George decided she was the most beautiful girl he had\\r\\never seen; Loto\\'s description did not half do her justice.</p>\\r\\n<p>She stood hesitantly in the doorway then, smiling, advanced to Loto and\\r\\ngave him both hands in a pretty gesture of welcome.</p>\\r\\n<p>George\\'s decision that Azeela was the prettiest girl he had ever seen\\r\\nwas short lived, for behind Azeela now came another girl, her younger\\r\\nsister, Dianne. Azeela might have been eighteen or nineteen; Dianne\\r\\nobviously was no more than sixteen—a black-haired, dark-eyed girl,\\r\\ndressed like Azeela, except that her sash was a deep red.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"And this is Dianne,\" Loto was saying. \"We call her Dee.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"So will I,\" George answered promptly. He met the girl\\'s eyes—snapping,\\r\\nlaughing eyes with the spirit of deviltry in them.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_90\">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>\"Loto told me about you,\" she said demurely. Her intonation was that of\\r\\na foreigner, but she spoke the ancient English with perfect ease and\\r\\nfluency. \"Loto said he thought I would like you a lot.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"He didn\\'t tell me about <i>you</i>,\" George responded. \"Not till ten minutes\\r\\nago. But, anyway, he was right. No, what I mean is—\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The rest of George\\'s speech was lost, for they were inside the house and\\r\\nFahn was advancing to meet them. The leader of the Scientists was a man\\r\\nof nearly seventy; a quiet, grave, dominating figure, tall and spare,\\r\\nbut perfectly erect. His face was smooth-shaven, his iron-gray hair long\\r\\nto the base of the neck. He was dressed in a paneled robe of black, with\\r\\na pleated white collar and cuffs.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I am glad, indeed, to have you with us,\" he said cordially to Rogers.\\r\\nHe spoke precisely, slowly and carefully, as one speaks a language newly\\r\\nmastered. \"I feel very close to you, now that my daughter Azeela is to\\r\\nmarry Loto. It makes me—\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Rogers stared blankly. \"Loto engaged? Why, Loto, you—\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"There was so much else to tell you, Father.\" Loto was covered with\\r\\nconfusion. \"Besides, I wanted to have you meet Azeela first.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Azeela was trying to escape from the room, but Dee captured her and\\r\\npushed her back.</p>\\r\\n<p>George was vigorously congratulating Loto, and Rogers, rising to the\\r\\noccasion, kissed Azeela heartily.</p>\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 45%;\">\\r\\n<p>It was an ominous crisis into which the visitors from a time world\\r\\ntwenty-eight thousand years previous had fallen. They discussed it with\\r\\nFahn and his daughters during the remainder of that morning, and at the\\r\\nlight noon meal, served in a shaded corner of the patio formed by the\\r\\nenclosing wings of the house. Banks of vivid flowers surrounded them;\\r\\nthe quiet, warm air was redolent with perfume. A small fountain splashed\\r\\nmusically. The world was calm, languorous.</p>\\r\\n<p>Fahn had little to add to what they already knew. Toroh<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_91\">[Pg 91]</a></span> and the Noths\\r\\nhad not been expected to attack for a month or two at least, and the\\r\\nAnglese scientists were going forward with their own preparations for\\r\\nthe war with utmost haste.</p>\\r\\n<p>But now these emissaries Toroh had smuggled to the island injected a new\\r\\nand alarming factor into the situation. They had appeared only in\\r\\nOrleen, but the Bas there were listening to them, and all over the\\r\\nisland the news was spreading among the Bas that Toroh was a friend, not\\r\\nan enemy. The Bas might be incited to open revolt.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Morgruud is alarmed,\" Fahn said to Loto. He explained to the others\\r\\nthat Mogruud was one of the most intelligent of the Bas in Anglese City,\\r\\na leader of his people. Mogruud was not fooled by Toroh\\'s emissaries,\\r\\nbut he feared now that he could not prevent an uprising.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"And the most terrible part is the Bas are right,\" Fahn added. \"I do not\\r\\nmean in regard to Toroh—he is a scoundrel, of course. But the Bas must\\r\\nhave some relief. Their children—ten mothers and infants were ordered\\r\\nexiled yesterday.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Why don\\'t you fix it?\" George asked.</p>\\r\\n<p>The Scientist leader shrugged slightly. \"I do not make the laws; I obey\\r\\nthem. I have remonstrated with the king and the council many times.\" He\\r\\npaused, then added thoughtfully:</p>\\r\\n<p>\"The time may come when we of the League may be forced to act against\\r\\nthe laws of our king. He is wrong, and we scientists all know it. But to\\r\\ntake the law into our own hands—it is a very drastic thing....\"</p>\\r\\n<p>During the meal, George was far more interested in the two sisters than\\r\\nin the men\\'s talk. He had opportunity now to study the girls, compare\\r\\nthem. In feature they were much alike; in expression and demeanor,\\r\\ntotally different. Azeela was calm, thoughtful—femininely wise and\\r\\npatient. Dee was impulsive, vivacious—alternately demure and devilish.\\r\\nYet, in spite of the differences in temperament, there seemed a strange\\r\\nbond between the sisters. Their regard for each other, the love between\\r\\nthem, was obvious. But it was more than that—a bond of mind and spirit.\\r\\nGeorge<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_92\">[Pg 92]</a></span> puzzled over it. Often when Azeela was about to speak, Dee would\\r\\nimpulsively speak for her, as though interpreting her sister\\'s thoughts.</p>\\r\\n<p>The afternoon was one of inactivity. A Toroh emissary appeared in\\r\\nAnglese City, but he was arrested before he had time to harangue the\\r\\npeople.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I had thought he was one of Toroh\\'s brothers,\" Fahn remarked, \"but it\\r\\nis not so. I think now they would not dare come back to the island.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He went on to explain that Toroh had two younger brothers, banished like\\r\\nhimself.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"They might come—Toroh himself might come,\" Loto declared. \"He will\\r\\ndare anything that seems worth the risk.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"If we take any one of them he will die,\" Fahn commented.</p>\\r\\n<p>It was at this juncture, in the late afternoon when the whole world was\\r\\nbathed in the glorious colors of a sunset sky, that Azeela returned from\\r\\na short trip across the city.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"The Aran Festival of the Flowers is tonight,\" she exclaimed excitedly.\\r\\n\"It has not been postponed. The Arans say it is clever to hold it now,\\r\\nin spite of the news from Orleen. It will show the Bas how little they\\r\\ncare—how secure is the Aran power!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>It seemed to presage evil events—the holding of this festival wherein\\r\\nall the wanton luxury of the Arans could be flaunted in the faces of\\r\\nthose whom they ruled. And it was with foreboding in their hearts that\\r\\nFahn, his daughters and their friends, prepared that evening to go and\\r\\nwitness it. It was midnight when they started. Dee and Azeela were\\r\\nswathed to the eyes in soft white robes, and the men carried tiny black\\r\\nmasks.</p>\\r\\n<p>The city streets, even at midnight, bore a holiday aspect. The moon had\\r\\nrisen but, in addition to its light, there were braziers strung above\\r\\nevery street crossing and they cast a soft blue light downward.</p>\\r\\n<p>Arans were hurrying along, alone and in groups—the women all shrouded\\r\\nin white; the men, in clothes of gaudy colors, wearing masks, or\\r\\ndangling them in their hands.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_93\">[Pg 93]</a></span> Little phaetons drawn by dogs rolled by,\\r\\nfilled with gay figures in fancy dress; women leaned from them, waving\\r\\nat the pedestrians and tossing out flowers as they swept past.</p>\\r\\n<p>Loto and Azeela, with George and Dee close behind them, led the way\\r\\nswiftly in the direction that every one else was moving. Fahn and Rogers\\r\\nfollowed behind.</p>\\r\\n<p>It was a fairy tale city of unreality: gaudy men and white robed women\\r\\nhastening forward under the blue street lights; silent white houses\\r\\nflushed with the reddish tinge of the moon; warm, moist air, almost\\r\\nwithout a breath, heavy with sensuous perfume.</p>\\r\\n<p>And in the shadows of the streets, the brown skinned, half naked figure\\r\\nof a Bas, skulking here and there!</p>\\r\\n<p>Azeela had, for some time, been walking in silence. She looked up at the\\r\\nmoon and, with a touch upon Loto\\'s arm, indicated it.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You said the moon was blushing, my Loto—the blush of maiden modesty to\\r\\nlook down upon such a city. But I do not see it so...to me it is\\r\\nstained with <i>blood</i>.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The sweeping gesture of her white arm flashing from under the robe\\r\\nindicated a garden beside them.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"<i>Blood—staining everything!</i>\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The street topped a rise of ground, ahead, down another short slope, lay\\r\\nthe sea. And even there the silver path upon the water was tinged with\\r\\nred.</p>\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 65%;\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER NINE</h2>\\r\\n<p>A cordon of police stopped Fahn and his party at the edge of a grove of\\r\\npalms near the beach. A moment more and they were inside. It was dim\\r\\nunder the palms; the white<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_94\">[Pg 94]</a></span> sand a lace pattern of shadow and moonlight.\\r\\nGay figures were moving about, all the men masked now.</p>\\r\\n<p>The grove covered perhaps a quarter of a mile. To the right lay the\\r\\ngleaming white beach with the surf rolling up upon it. A tremendous pile\\r\\nof scarlet and white blossoms stood near by under the palm trees.\\r\\nFigures rushed to it, gathered up armfuls and darted away, shouting and\\r\\nlaughing.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"We must keep together,\" Fahn warned. \"Come this way.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Half a dozen men had whirled up, pelting Azeela and Dee with flower\\r\\nblossoms, and, under cover of the laughing attack, tried to separate the\\r\\ngirls from their escorts and carry them off.</p>\\r\\n<p>They moved slowly forward, George gripping Dee\\'s arm tightly. They\\r\\npassed a huge, rectangular swimming pool, deserted as yet—glassy,\\r\\nmoonlit water a foot or two below the surface of the ground, reflecting\\r\\nthe dark outlines of the date palms that curved above it.</p>\\r\\n<p>The whirling crowd constantly became thicker. There must have been\\r\\nseveral thousand people within the grove: the white shrouded figure of a\\r\\nwoman flinging flowers against the attack of a man; a woman retreating,\\r\\nher ammunition exhausted, to the flower pile to replenish, and being\\r\\ncaught in a smothering embrace before she could reach it; a group of\\r\\nlaughing girls, their robes torn from them in the fray, pelting a\\r\\ndefenseless man, flinging him finally into a huge pile of flower petals,\\r\\nburying him until some other quarry distracted their attention, or a\\r\\nstronger force of men separated them, sometimes carrying them off\\r\\nbodily.</p>\\r\\n<p>And in nooks behind the hedges of flowers, couples stole silent\\r\\nembraces, alone until marauding bands of men or girls found them out and\\r\\ndrove them from their seclusion.</p>\\r\\n<p>The white sand was thick with trampled flowers. Music came drifting\\r\\nthrough the warm night air; music near at hand, but blurred by the\\r\\nshouts of the whirling throng. The rich contralto voice of a woman\\r\\nsinging—a snatch cut off by laughter.</p>\\r\\n<p>A large white pavilion lay ahead, brilliant with flashing<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_95\">[Pg 95]</a></span> colored\\r\\nlights—a kaleidoscope of shifting color. It seemed crowded with people,\\r\\nand Fahn now led his little party toward it.</p>\\r\\n<p>They did not enter the pavilion, but stood in a group on its steps. The\\r\\nmusic came from within, music that welled and throbbed, unfamiliar in\\r\\ncharacter, but with the age-old appeal to the senses—music sensuous,\\r\\nbarbaric. And yet was it barbaric?</p>\\r\\n<p>Rogers voiced the question in a whisper to Loto, who stood beside him.\\r\\nWas it not rather supermodern, with the centuries of decadence that had\\r\\nput into it that fire of the soul abandoned to the body?</p>\\r\\n<p>The throng on the floor was battling with flowers, drinking wine from\\r\\ncarved bowls of coconut shell, and dancing indiscriminately. The masked\\r\\nmen were robed in black and women shrouded in white, but the swinging\\r\\nlights of vivid color stained everything, made the scene shift and blur\\r\\ninto fantasy.</p>\\r\\n<p>At one end of the room a huge circular table was loaded with food and\\r\\ndrink, fruits and confections. The table was slowly revolving; half of\\r\\nits circumference was behind a partition—a kitchen where it was\\r\\nconstantly being replenished with other dainties.</p>\\r\\n<p>The visitors found it difficult to keep their place on the pavilion\\r\\nsteps. Masked men attacked the two girls with flowers; a black robed\\r\\nfigure in mock politeness and humility begged one or the other of them\\r\\nto dance. A trio of girls tore George away, and then, at his resistance,\\r\\nleft him abruptly.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"The king,\" whispered Loto, with a gesture.</p>\\r\\n<p>At one end of the pavilion, on a small raised platform, the king sat\\r\\nsmiling down upon the scene. He was robed in paneled cloth of rich,\\r\\ngaudy colors—a man of middle age whose long, dark hair was shot through\\r\\nwith gray.</p>\\r\\n<p>The scene, with its confusion of shifting incidents, held too much for\\r\\nthe visitors to see or to understand. Half an hour went by, with the\\r\\nmerrymaking steadily increasing. Abruptly, the music stopped. The throng\\r\\nstopped in its<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_96\">[Pg 96]</a></span> tracks, waiting expectantly. The swinging colored lights\\r\\ndied out; others took their place—pure blue-white, and motionless. A\\r\\nsolemn bell tolled out over the silence; with almost one motion the\\r\\nmasks and the robes were discarded. A woman\\'s laugh rang out, carrying\\r\\nin it the very essence of abandonment. Then the music began again and\\r\\nthe throng sprang back into motion.</p>\\r\\n<p>The riotous color had been supplied by the lights; now with the lights a\\r\\nblue-white, steady glare, it was the riotous color of the costumes\\r\\nthemselves. Was it the Baghdad of the Ancients—manikins, with turbaned\\r\\nheaddresses, and flowing, vivid draperies with the gleaming white of\\r\\nlimbs beneath them? Or were these slave girls, with their wares\\r\\ndisplayed for the bidders in the market? Or these others, were they\\r\\ndesert women, dancing with a pagan lust?</p>\\r\\n<p>Watching with the others, George\\'s impressions were confused. Yet the\\r\\nthought came to him that this was modern beyond his time—decadence, not\\r\\nbarbarism.</p>\\r\\n<p>Again Rogers murmured something, but his words were lost. A score of\\r\\nfigures came leaping from the pavilion, scattering the small group of\\r\\nonlookers on its steps.</p>\\r\\n<p>Rogers recovered himself, turning to follow them with his gaze; white\\r\\nnymphs with flowing hair, and draperies of gauze that bellowed behind\\r\\nthem as they ran for the moonlit beach and the surf.</p>\\r\\n<p>Loto, pulling at his father\\'s arm, brought his attention back to the\\r\\npavilion. Through it, the palm grove on the other side was visible.</p>\\r\\n<p>The bathing pool was now a turmoil of splashing figures—slim white\\r\\nshapes dove into it from the palm-lined banks.</p>\\r\\n<p>But Loto was indicating the pavilion\\'s interior. The crowd was standing\\r\\nmotionless, gazing upward. A small dais was poised in mid-air above the\\r\\nfloor in the center of the room. It floated there, seemingly with\\r\\nnothing to sustain it. Standing on tiptoe on the dais was a woman,\\r\\nwrapped to the eyes in scarlet draperies. She was facing the king over a\\r\\ndistance of some twenty feet. The music, which had been stilled for a\\r\\nmoment, murmured softly from its unseen niche.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_97\">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>Fahn whispered to Rogers, \"Our workmen of the League equipped that dais\\r\\nfor the king. He begged us—and I feel now that it was a mistake.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Loto added: \"It is made from our newly invented war equipment. The dais\\r\\nis covered with a fabric—electrically charged, and repulsive to the\\r\\nearth. It\\'s radio controlled, Father. A workman from the cavern is over\\r\\nthere in the corner, behind that drape. We\\'ve kept the fabric a secret,\\r\\nbut the king wanted to use it for the dais.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The woman was singing in a throbbing contralto, very soft at first, then\\r\\ngradually louder. As she sang, slowly she unwound the draperies, letting\\r\\nthem drop from her like quivering flame to a smoldering pile at her\\r\\nfeet. Beneath it were other draperies, flame-colored like the rest, but\\r\\nher arms and face were bare—full, rounded, milk-white arms—a heavy\\r\\nface with scarlet lips.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Helene,\" Loto whispered. \"The Bas call her what means \\'Mme. Voluptua.\\'\\r\\nIt is she who rules the king <i>and the nation</i>. Look at her!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The king was standing up. The music grew louder, fiercer, with a\\r\\nthrilling minor cadence. The woman\\'s arms were extended; she stood\\r\\npoised, smiling as she sang to the king. From her outflung arms the\\r\\ngauze drapery hung like quivering wings, with the white of her body\\r\\ngleaming beneath it. The black hair piled high on her head held two\\r\\nspangles of gold trembling at the end of delicate golden wires. She\\r\\nstood, a great scarlet moth, hovering before flight.</p>\\r\\n<p>Staring in fascination, the king had left his seat and descended to the\\r\\nfloor. The crowd parted to make way for him as he slowly moved toward\\r\\nthe dais which floated down to meet him. Every eye was on him and on the\\r\\nwoman, who now was extending her arms down in invitation.</p>\\r\\n<p>The music and the song were at their height. The dais reached the floor;\\r\\nthe king stepped upon it and, as the woman\\'s hand touched his shoulder,\\r\\nhe dropped on one knee before her, his lips at the hem of her scarlet\\r\\ngauze.</p>\\r\\n<p>A leer of triumph on the woman\\'s face; a murmur of<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_98\">[Pg 98]</a></span> applause from the\\r\\nwatching throng. Then a black cloak fell from a figure close beside the\\r\\ndais; a man leaped upon it—the naked figure of a man in loin-cloth. A\\r\\nknife flashed—blue-white steel in the light from above. The song rose\\r\\nto a shuddering scream. The scarlet figure wilted and sank among its\\r\\ndraperies at the feet of the kneeling king.</p>\\r\\n<p>For an instant the colorful throng seemed frozen; then chaos and the\\r\\nstruggling, airless confusion of panic. The murderer had flung the king\\r\\nand the body of the woman from the dais. The little platform was rising\\r\\ninto the air, carrying him with it. The movement was sidewise; in a\\r\\nmoment it would have been outside the pavilion.</p>\\r\\n<p>Rogers, standing beside Fahn, heard the Scientist leader mutter an oath.\\r\\nFahn\\'s hand came up from his robe; a pencil-point of flame—a tiny\\r\\nshaft, yellow-red—shot from his weapon. The platform crashed to the\\r\\nfloor of the pavilion; the murderer lay still, his body blackened and\\r\\ncharred.</p>\\r\\n<p>In the center of the room, the king had climbed to his feet, trembling.\\r\\nHe stood, staring down at the scarlet pile of gauze before him, the\\r\\ncrumbled white body stained red as the draperies in which it lay.</p>\\r\\n<p>The pavilion was emptying. The music was stilled; shouts of men,\\r\\nterrified, hysterical cries of women filled the air. The visitors on the\\r\\nsteps were swept back by the crowds from within. Loto, clinging to his\\r\\nfather, struggled to hold them together.</p>\\r\\n<p>White figures were running from the beach; slim shapes were climbing\\r\\nfrom the bathing pool. A woman hastened by, long black hair plastered\\r\\nwet against her sleek white body. Her face, the allure gone from it, was\\r\\na white mask of horror; a scarlet mouth with lips parted to yield\\r\\nbabbling, terrified cries. She swept past, then disappeared into the\\r\\nconfusion of the night.</p>\\r\\n<p>Loto was still clutching his father; all the rest of their party had\\r\\ndisappeared. The pavilion now was empty of Arans, save for that huddled\\r\\nscarlet form, deserted by all its kind.</p>\\r\\n<p>Fahn came hastening up. \"That is one of Toroh\\'s brothers.\"<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_99\">[Pg 99]</a></span> He pointed\\r\\nto the motionless figure of the man his jet of flame had killed. \"The\\r\\nother brother murdered my operator. They planned to steal the fabric, to\\r\\nduplicate it and use it against us in the war. I had no idea they would\\r\\ndare come to the island.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Fahn had found his radio operator lying dead in his place behind the\\r\\ndrape. Toroh\\'s other brother had been there, trying to work the radio\\r\\nand get the dais out of the pavilion so that in the confusion they might\\r\\nescape with it. Fahn had caught a glimpse of the man running away as he\\r\\napproached. They had not known of Fahn\\'s presence at the festival; had\\r\\nhe not been there, the attempt probably would have succeeded.</p>\\r\\n<p>There was space around the three men now. The fleeing Aran figures were\\r\\nvanishing through the palms; the confused cries were growing fainter.\\r\\nBut George and the two girls could not be found.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"We must go back,\" Fahn said. \"They must have tried to find us and could\\r\\nnot. They would go home at once.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>With a last search around them, the three men started off through the\\r\\nnow almost deserted grove. The cordon of police had disappeared. A few\\r\\nhastening figures were scattered along the streets.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Come on,\" Loto cried anxiously. \"We have to hurry.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Keeping close together they hastened along. Aran figures scurried here\\r\\nand there; lights twinkled in the houses, then were extinguished as\\r\\nthough the concealing darkness might offer protection.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Curious,\" murmured Rogers. \"The entire city is in terror.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"The guilt that has been within them for generations,\" Fahn answered.\\r\\n\"Toroh planned this well. The Bas will not know it was an attempt to\\r\\nsteal the fabric. Instead they will think that one of their own people\\r\\ndared to murder Mme. Voluptua. The Arans think that now. They think the\\r\\nBas have risen to rebellion at last. It is not this one murder, but the\\r\\nmeaning of it that they fear—the confidence it will give the Bas.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>And as though to confirm his words, the figure of a Bas<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_100\">[Pg 100]</a></span> man stood\\r\\nmotionless on the next street corner. He was partly in shadow, but he\\r\\ndid not move as the three men came along; and as they passed, his body\\r\\nseemed to straighten, with the consciousness of his own power sweeping\\r\\nover it.</p>\\r\\n<p>They hurried across the city. As they went, they passed other Bas—Bas\\r\\nwho no longer skulked in the shadows.</p>\\r\\n<p>At last they came to the shimmering, moonlit garden of Fahn\\'s home. The\\r\\nhouse was dark. They called, but no one answered. A brief search\\r\\nrevealed the truth; Azeela, George and Dee were not to be found. The\\r\\nplace was undisturbed; there seemed no evidence of marauders.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"We must wait,\" Fahn said. But his tone was anxious. \"They have not yet\\r\\narrived from the grove. I cannot believe it is anything but that.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>For a time they waited, but none of the missing three appeared. A hum\\r\\nhad been growing in the city—a murmur of distant cries that now forced\\r\\nitself on their attention. The murmur grew, resolving itself into shouts\\r\\nand the scuffle of running feet. A mob of Bas rounded a nearby street\\r\\ncorner and swept past the house. The crowd might have held a thousand\\r\\npersons. A giant, half-naked man with a curved sword-blade in his hand\\r\\nwas leading the way; behind him came hordes of brown-skinned men and\\r\\nwomen. Most of the men carried curved swords; the women wielded\\r\\nsticks—the heavy butts of palm-fronds with the green stripped off—and\\r\\na variety of agricultural implements.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"The cane-cutters!\" Loto exclaimed softly. \"The knives with which they\\r\\ncut the sugar cane. They—\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He broke off, watching the grim mob as it swept by. At every corner it\\r\\nwas strengthened by others who joined it; Bas were springing up\\r\\nmiraculously from the shadows everywhere.</p>\\r\\n<p>Fahn\\'s hand had gone to his belt; then it dropped to his side. Rogers\\r\\nmet the Scientist\\'s glance with a nod of understanding.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"It is what we of the League have feared for years,\" Fahn said\\r\\nanxiously. \"I cannot kill my own people. I am<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_101\">[Pg 101]</a></span> armed and they are not,\\r\\nyet I cannot kill them—cannot look upon them as enemies. And I think,\\r\\neven in their frenzy, they realize that and play upon it.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The last stragglers had passed; the shouts of the mob were growing\\r\\nfainter as it dashed across the city. The Aran houses were still dark\\r\\nand silent, with only an occasional inmate slinking out to gaze\\r\\nfearfully around. Directly across the street, the white figure of a\\r\\nwoman just returned from the grove showed for an instant in a doorway.\\r\\nThen it fled inward, into the darkness.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"<i>The palace!</i>\" Loto explained abruptly. \"<i>They\\'re going to the\\r\\npalace!</i>\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The words seemed to bring to Fahn the realization that action by him was\\r\\nneeded. For the moment his anxiety over his daughters became secondary.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Come!\" he cried. \"We must protect the king.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He hurried them through the garden and along the street. Almost running,\\r\\nthe three men headed toward where the mob could still be heard, shouting\\r\\nin the distance.</p>\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 65%;\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER TEN</h2>\\r\\n<p>George had been standing with his friends beside the pavilion, silently\\r\\nwatching the festival reach its height. The bell tolled; the masks and\\r\\ncloaks were discarded. A bevy of nymphs draped in flowing gauze came\\r\\ndashing out. As they passed, one of them caught George by the arm,\\r\\npulling him along a few steps; her eyes, half hidden by her tumbling\\r\\nhair, mocked him provocatively.</p>\\r\\n<p>He jerked away. A tide of other figures flowed from the pavilion,\\r\\nfollowing the nymphs to the beach. George fought<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_102\">[Pg 102]</a></span> his way back, seeking\\r\\nto rejoin his friends; in that crowd they could get lost so easily.</p>\\r\\n<p>He was looking about, wondering just where they had been standing\\r\\nbefore, when he saw Dee. Her white cloak had fallen from her head to her\\r\\nshoulders. She was standing alone, apparently lost in reverie.</p>\\r\\n<p>George hastened to her. \"Where are—\"</p>\\r\\n<p>But her vehement gesture silenced him; again she seemed lost in thought.\\r\\nFor a moment he stood wondering what was the matter with her. The music\\r\\nfrom the pavilion throbbed out into the moonlit grove; gaiety was\\r\\nsurging all around them.</p>\\r\\n<p>Finally George could stand it no longer. \"Dee, what is it? What\\'s the\\r\\nmatter?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>She looked up with an anxious frown. \"Something is wrong with Azeela.\\r\\nShe\\'s trying to tell me what\\'s wrong.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Oh?\" George glanced hastily about. \"Where is Azeela? She was here a\\r\\nminute ago. Where are the rest of them? Let\\'s tell them.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>What did Dee mean? The girl seemed to have forgotten him again. She was\\r\\nmoving away, like one who walks under a spell.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Wait. Dee—<i>wait a minute</i>!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>She kept on going. Figures were passing between them now. George hated\\r\\nto leave his place. He\\'d never find the others—never get back again.\\r\\nEven now he realized it would be difficult, if not impossible, to find\\r\\nthem in all that crowd of masked figures. If he lost Dee, too... He had\\r\\nno choice; he darted after Dee.</p>\\r\\n<p>When he had overtaken her they were some distance from the pavilion. It\\r\\nwas more secluded here. George darted up and caught her by the arm.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Dee! What\\'s the matter with you?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Her hand went over her eyes and she shook herself slightly. \"It\\'s hard\\r\\nat first—getting Azeela\\'s thoughts. I have them now.\" She spoke\\r\\nswiftly, anxiously. \"Toroh was here a moment ago. He seized Azeela and\\r\\ntook her out of the grove—right near here.\"<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_103\">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>Azeela\\'s thoughts! George understood. He started forward, but she held\\r\\nhim.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Too late! Toroh had two dogs waiting for him—they\\'re mounting them\\r\\nnow. He has tied Azeela. They\\'re starting—the dogs are running.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>George stared at her blankly. \"Where to? Where is he taking her? Can you\\r\\nask her that? Can she tell you?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The girl was hastening forward now, with George after her. \"Yes. She\\r\\nsays to Orleen. I have told her we are coming.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Abruptly, she stopped and faced him. \"George, we have two dogs at home.\\r\\nShall you and I get them and go after Azeela?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes,\" he exclaimed impulsively.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"And I know where father keeps his weapons.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Good. We can\\'t find Loto and your father in this crowd. Had we better\\r\\ntry, Dee?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>They were hurrying forward again.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"No, we\\'d lose too much time. Father forbade me touching his weapons,\"\\r\\nshe added as an afterthought, \"but this is different, isn\\'t it?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Of course,\" he agreed excitedly. \"You know how to work them, Dee?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes, I experimented. He doesn\\'t know it.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>They left the grove.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Dee, where\\'s Azeela now?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Crossing the city. West toward Orleen. We won\\'t be far behind them.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>George was trembling with the excitement of it. \"Is Toroh armed? Ask\\r\\nAzeela that.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I did. She doesn\\'t know. She thinks he is.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Oh!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"We\\'ll do something. He won\\'t know we\\'re after him—that\\'s our\\r\\nadvantage. Hurry, George!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>There were a few figures in the almost deserted streets, but George and\\r\\nDee did not notice them. She was telling him of this branch of science\\r\\nfor which she and her sister were distinguished—this telepathy they had\\r\\ndeveloped.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_104\">[Pg 104]</a></span> Bound in a union of thought by an unusual devotion, they had\\r\\nperfected it until they could know, always vaguely, and, with effort,\\r\\nquite distinctly, what was in the other\\'s mind.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"We mustn\\'t waste any time getting started, Dee.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>They had entered the silent garden of Fahn\\'s home. The city behind them\\r\\nwas humming with confusion now, but they did not hear it, did not know\\r\\nthat a murder had just been committed at the festival.</p>\\r\\n<p>Inside the house, Dee went at once to her father\\'s room. George waited.\\r\\nWhen she returned she held two weapons out for his inspection. One was a\\r\\ncrescent of transparent metal, with a tiny wire connecting its horns and\\r\\na black bone handle by which to grasp it. There was a firing mechanism\\r\\non the handle. It was the projector of the ray which caused muscular\\r\\nparalysis—the weapon Bool had used against Loto.</p>\\r\\n<p>Dee described its operation briefly.</p>\\r\\n<p>The other weapon was a small black globe the size of a man\\'s fist. It\\r\\nalso had a handle with a trigger; in the globe opposite was a tiny\\r\\norifice like the muzzle of a revolver. This was one of the smallest\\r\\nmodels of the thunderbolt projectors. With it, a bolt of electrons could\\r\\nbe thrown over a distance of some twenty feet.</p>\\r\\n<p>The former weapon Dee kept; the little thunderbolt globe she handed to\\r\\nGeorge.</p>\\r\\n<p>Dee had discarded her white robe; a blue ribbon around her forehead held\\r\\nthe hair from her eyes. She had another in her hand, and she tied it\\r\\naround George\\'s head.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"It\\'s hot riding, even at night,\" she explained. \"Your hair gets\\r\\nmoist—gets in your eyes.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>They had been delayed only a moment.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"This way,\" she added.</p>\\r\\n<p>They ran outside, across the patio, through a dark room and into the\\r\\ngarden behind the house, where a small white outbuilding stood. A new\\r\\nmisgiving overcame George.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Oh, Dee—these dogs of yours...\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Can you ride a dog?\" she asked over her shoulder. Her expression was\\r\\nimpish.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_105\">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>\"I can ride anything,\" he said stoutly, but his tone was dubious. \"If\\r\\nthe dog is—\"</p>\\r\\n<p>She must have understood him, for she laughed.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Wait! You will find these dogs your friends.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>George said nothing more, and in a moment they were within the kennel.\\r\\nIt was dark, very dimly lighted by the moon from outside. A gray-black\\r\\nshape came toward them; a shaggy dog whose shoulders stood nearly as\\r\\nhigh as his own. George\\'s first instinct was to turn and run, but the\\r\\ndog padded up to Dee, and she put her arms up around it.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Good, Rotan. Will you run fast for Dee?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>She called it toward George, and patted him to show the dog he was her\\r\\nfriend. George impulsively put his hand up to the great shaggy neck,\\r\\nfelt the dog\\'s warm tongue as it turned to lick his hand. This huge\\r\\nbrute was his friend.</p>\\r\\n<p>The other dog, Atal was a male, larger than its mate; and standing\\r\\nbeside it, George marveled at the power that its great body must hold.\\r\\nThe dogs knew they were going out. They whined with eagerness, and\\r\\nleaping across the kennel, they came back to Dee with saddles in their\\r\\nmouths with which she was to harness them.</p>\\r\\n<p>Rotan, which Dee was to ride, was saddled with a leather seat and a\\r\\npommel with a small stirrup on one side. It was not unlike the\\r\\nsidesaddle for girls that had been in use just before George\\'s time. On\\r\\nAtal she strapped a thick leather pad with a stirrup on each side; men\\r\\nrode astride. There were no bridles.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You tell Atal which way to go,\" she explained. \"Right or left, slower\\r\\nor faster. If you want him to run or walk or stop, he will understand.\\r\\nSince Loto came we have taught them your way of saying it.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>It all took no more than a moment or two, for Dee was hurrying, and her\\r\\neagerness seemed to communicate itself to the dogs. They had barked at\\r\\nfirst—barks of such volume that George was startled. But when Dee\\r\\nsilenced them, they stood trembling with impatience, their heads turned\\r\\nto follow her as she adjusted the saddles.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_106\">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>George mounted Atal. It was almost like mounting a horse; and yet not\\r\\nlike a horse either, for the dog\\'s huge body under him was springy,\\r\\nsupple. As it moved toward the doorway, George was reminded of the lithe\\r\\ngrace and strength of a tiger. He missed the reins, and in lieu of them,\\r\\ntwisted up two handfuls of hair on the dog\\'s neck and clung.</p>\\r\\n<p>Dee was ahead of him. \"All right, George?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Right,\" he said confidently. \"But we might as well take it slow for a\\r\\nminute or two.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>They moved silently through the garden. George leaned forward and down\\r\\nto the dog\\'s face.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Nice dog, Atal. You go slow till I tell you different.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>In the street, Dee was drawing away, and Atal broke into a run.</p>\\r\\n<p>George clung desperately. But it was unnecessary. The dog\\'s strides were\\r\\neven and long; its padded paws made no sound as they hit the ground; its\\r\\nlegs, all its muscles, seemed to give to the shock and absorb it.</p>\\r\\n<p>They were running faster now; the dog\\'s body seemed to settle closer to\\r\\nthe ground. The wind whistled by George\\'s ears, but he felt curiously\\r\\nsecure. There was no question of the dog stumbling, falling; and its\\r\\ngait, now at a steady run, was far easier to ride than any horse he had\\r\\never mounted.</p>\\r\\n<p>Dee was still ahead; the ends of the ribbon band about her head\\r\\nfluttered out behind her. The white road was a blur; the houses and\\r\\ngardens of the city were flying past.</p>\\r\\n<p>An exhilaration—a feeling of triumph and power—came over George. He\\r\\nwas perfectly at home on the dog\\'s back now. This little Dee was a\\r\\ndaredevil, as Loto had said. Well, that was the sort of girl he liked.\\r\\nThey\\'ll overtake Toroh, kill him with a flash from the thunderbolt\\r\\nglobes and rescue Azeela.</p>\\r\\n<p>George leaned forward over the dog\\'s neck.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"We might as well catch up with Dee,\" he said into the silky ear.\\r\\n\"Faster, Atal!\"<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_107\">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>At once the dog increased its pace, overtaking its mate. Side by side,\\r\\nthey swept through the city.</p>\\r\\n<p>To George the ride soon became a blur: a white moonlit road passing\\r\\nunder him, palm trees flashing by, occasional houses, thatched shacks;\\r\\nthe wind whistling past his ears, and that lithe, powerful body beneath\\r\\nhim, with its rippling muscles.</p>\\r\\n<p>Dee rode gracefully and easily, leaning slightly forward into the rush\\r\\nof air. Often she would draw ahead, but a whispered word from George to\\r\\nthe brute beneath him, and again the dogs were running side by side.</p>\\r\\n<p>Presently Dee stopped them; the dogs stood panting, with tongues lolling\\r\\nout.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"What is it?\" George demanded. \"Where are we?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The girl\\'s face was drawn with anxiety. \"Azeela had been trying to find\\r\\nout from Toroh why he takes her to Orleen.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes?\" he prompted. \"And I wondered—\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Toroh has told her now. Loto\\'s old plane is there. He wants the plane!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Oh!\" George\\'s heart sank with dismay. \"But the plane is in the Orleen\\r\\nCavern. How can they get to it? Isn\\'t the cavern guarded?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes. Wait. Toroh says he can get it. He has a spy there—a man whom we\\r\\ntrust. One of the guards.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Good grief! Dee, where are they now?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"A few miles west of here. I can\\'t tell how far—Azeela does not know\\r\\njust where we are, either.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Does Toroh know we\\'re after him?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"No.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>George tried to think coherently. \"Can\\'t we overtake them, Dee? Before\\r\\nthey reach Orleen?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I don\\'t know. Azeela says not. Their dogs are very fast—perhaps faster\\r\\nthan ours.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Suddenly George had an inspiration. The other plane—the one he and\\r\\nRogers had come in! It was back in the cavern in Anglese City. He and\\r\\nDee could get that, and he could operate it—he\\'d have to, now. Then\\r\\nthey could fly to Orleen,<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_108\">[Pg 108]</a></span> and perhaps by that method get there before\\r\\nToroh and Azeela.</p>\\r\\n<p>He explained this swifty to Dee. \"We\\'re not so far from Anglese City,\\r\\nare we?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"No,\" she agreed. \"It\\'s the best thing to do.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>They turned the dogs, starting back over the road they had come.</p>\\r\\n<p>A new thought occurred to George. \"Dee, what does Toroh want with that\\r\\nplane? Is he going to take Azeela north in it?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The dogs were already at a run, but he caught her answer.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"No. He will take the plane back into time! He wants to get greater\\r\\nweapons with which to conquer us!\"</p>\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 45%;\">\\r\\n<p>Fahn, Loto and Rogers hurried through the city streets. The faint\\r\\ndistant cries of the mob ahead drifted back to them. There were no Arans\\r\\nto be seen, but the Bas men and women were everywhere, most of them\\r\\nmoving in the direction of the palace.</p>\\r\\n<p>As Fahn and his two companions advanced, the turmoil ahead grew louder.\\r\\nThe palace stood on a rise of ground in the midst of a lavish garden,\\r\\nwith its swimming pool, its trellised pergolas and its graceful palms.\\r\\nThe building was a two story rectangular, with huge white columns from\\r\\nthe ground to the roof. A broad balcony ran the length of the second\\r\\nstory. The roof was flat, with palms growing upon it.</p>\\r\\n<p>A crowd of Bas was surging up the hill toward the palace; in the\\r\\ngardens, the armed mob was already massed, shouting, threatening, but\\r\\nlacking, as yet, the courage to advance upon the building.</p>\\r\\n<p>Fahn had turned into a side street at the foot of the hill.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Where are we going?\" Rogers demanded.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"We\\'ve got to get into the palace unseen, so we\\'ll go through the\\r\\ntower,\" Loto explained. \"There\\'s a secret way into it that the Bas don\\'t\\r\\nknow.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The tower, which rose like the skeleton of a lighthouse, stood close\\r\\nbeside the main palace building; a covered<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_109\">[Pg 109]</a></span> bridge connecting the two as\\r\\nthe level of the second floor of the palace.</p>\\r\\n<p>Swiftly Fahn led the two men to the beach that lay behind the bluff on\\r\\nwhich the palace and its tower stood. The moonlit strand was deserted.\\r\\nThey came to a thick clump of palmettos in the heavy sand at the foot of\\r\\nthe bluff—a green tangled clump higher than a man\\'s head. Into this\\r\\nFahn plunged unhesitatingly, forcing the fronds aside, pushing his way\\r\\nin with the others after him. Inside the palmetto thicket was a small\\r\\ntunnel mouth, leading downward.</p>\\r\\n<p>It seemed an endless journey through a black underground passageway not\\r\\nmuch higher than their heads and so narrow that they could always touch\\r\\nboth its walls with their outstretched arms. The air was heavy and\\r\\nfetid. They went down a slope, across on a level, then up. Once they\\r\\narrived at an iron grating barring the way. But Fahn opened it in some\\r\\nfashion and it swung on a central, horizontal pivot so that they might\\r\\ncrawl under it.</p>\\r\\n<p>Ahead of them, up the incline, a tiny blue light shone. They reached it,\\r\\nfound a small circular staircase and climbed upward into the tower.</p>\\r\\n<p>The whole process had taken perhaps fifteen minutes. The mob was still\\r\\nin the garden; its shouts and mutterings sounded loud and ominous as the\\r\\nlittle party ascended the interior of the tower and hastily crossed the\\r\\ncovered bridge.</p>\\r\\n<p>Fahn was still leading the way. They pushed aside a curtained doorway\\r\\nand found themselves in a broad, second-floor corridor of the palace,\\r\\ndimly lighted. A white-bearded old man was crossing it hastily,\\r\\ndisappearing into a room at its further end.</p>\\r\\n<p>Another room was near at hand, with a latticed grating in its doorway\\r\\nthat now stood open. A soft, blue-white light flooded out through it to\\r\\nthe hall. The castle\\'s interior was evidently in confusion; cries\\r\\nsounded, mingled with the threatening shouts of the mob outside.</p>\\r\\n<p>A girl, shaking with fright, stood in the nearer doorway, the light from\\r\\nbehind glowing through her soft draperies. Other girls crowded forward\\r\\nfrom the room—a dozen fright<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_110\">[Pg 110]</a></span>ened young girls, no more than matured.\\r\\nThey saw Fahn, and ran to him for protection.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"The king\\'s wives,\" Loto explained to his father.</p>\\r\\n<p>Fahn\\'s face softened, and as the girls huddled round him, he tried to\\r\\ncomfort them.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"The guilt within them,\" muttered Rogers. \"They think the Bas are coming\\r\\nto kill them—<i>only them</i>.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Fahn caught the words and his eyes flashed. \"There is no guilt here, my\\r\\nfriend. They are women born to such as this.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>With the girls in a clinging group around him, the scientist proceeded\\r\\ndown the hallway, followed by Loto and his father.</p>\\r\\n<p>The room at the end of the hall—it seemed a sort of audience room—was\\r\\nin confusion; most of the occupants of the palace were gathered there.\\r\\nThe king was pacing up and down near the entrance, his frightened\\r\\ncouncilors and advisors around him.</p>\\r\\n<p>On a low divan sat the queen, a woman of forty, regal in a paneled robe,\\r\\nwith her hair dressed high on her head. At her knees two children were\\r\\nhuddled—the little prince and princess of the Arans. The queen was\\r\\nbending down over them as the strangers entered. When she saw Fahn with\\r\\nthe girl-wives of her king, she frowned, stood up, and with an imperious\\r\\ngesture ordered the girls from the room. But Fahn, with a stern command,\\r\\nbade them stay. The queen seemed amazed at the scientist\\'s defiance; the\\r\\nking looked undecided, but he did not interfere.</p>\\r\\n<p>With Fahn\\'s arrival, the room quieted; its occupants gained confidence.\\r\\nThe king seemed utterly relieved. He spoke a few placating words to the\\r\\nqueen, but she had withdrawn haughtily to a corner, her eyes flashing at\\r\\nthe frightened girls who were huddled across the room.</p>\\r\\n<p>The mob outside was shouting, surging about, but still lacking the\\r\\ncourage for a concerted attack. Fahn went to a window, with Rogers and\\r\\nLoto after him. The moonlight outside showed the crowd plainly. The Bas\\r\\nwere waving their weapons.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_111\">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>\"Look!\" Loto exclaimed.</p>\\r\\n<p>A score or more of men were gathering in a group near the center of the\\r\\ngarden. A man mounted the rim of a fountain, inciting the group with his\\r\\nshouts. His words had effect. The little knot of men waved their\\r\\ncane-knives and came surging toward the palace entrance. The crowd made\\r\\nway for them, following behind with shouts of triumph. Missiles were\\r\\nthrown upward at the palace windows; one or two at first, then a\\r\\nhailstorm.</p>\\r\\n<p>Fahn quietly stepped out on a balcony that ran along the entire front of\\r\\nthe building. Loto and his father followed. The moonlight fell full upon\\r\\nthem, and the crowd recognized the Scientists\\' leader.</p>\\r\\n<p>A great shout went up—a cry of defiance mingled with fear. The men\\r\\nrushing at the building wavered and stopped; the crowd near at hand\\r\\nbegan pressing backward.</p>\\r\\n<p>Slowly, Fahn advanced to the waist-high parapet; with his hands upon it\\r\\nhe stood like an orator facing a friendly throng and calmly waited for\\r\\nsilence. A stone whistled past his head, struck the building and\\r\\nclattered to the stone floor of the balcony, but he did not heed it.</p>\\r\\n<p>His calmness, the confident power of his demeanor, quieted the mob. In a\\r\\nlittle open space on the terrace, a leader of the Bas sprang into\\r\\nprominence—a giant man who shouted a brief sentence.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Mogruud,\" whispered Loto. \"He tells them to listen to what Fahn has to\\r\\nsay.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Silence came at last, and then Fahn spoke, quietly, earnestly. He seemed\\r\\nto be winning them over, when from the palace behind the king suddenly\\r\\nappeared on the balcony. At the sight of him an angry shout rolled up\\r\\nfrom the crowd. A long, thin knife, with a tail of feathers on it, flew\\r\\nup from below and stuck, quivering, in the window casement beside the\\r\\nking\\'s head. The king retreated.</p>\\r\\n<p>Fahn continued speaking, but now the mob would not listen to him. A\\r\\nwoman\\'s shrill laugh of derision floated upward.</p>\\r\\n<p>At once Fahn\\'s tone changed. He rasped out a stern<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_112\">[Pg 112]</a></span> command, but a\\r\\nscattering hail of stones was his answer. Then, without warning, his\\r\\nhand went to his robe. He flung a little ball into the air. It burst\\r\\nfifty feet from his hand with a shrill whistling scream, and a shower of\\r\\nsparks scattered downward over the garden. They were harmless, but they\\r\\nsent a mild electric shock through every individual member of the mob.\\r\\nThe Bas were frightened into silence.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"He does not want to kill even one of them,\" Loto whispered. \"Never\\r\\nbefore have the Bas been in open demonstration. It might spread to other\\r\\ncities—<i>anything might happen</i>.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Fahn was now whispering into a tiny mouthpiece, talking to his guards at\\r\\nthe cavern a mile or so away. From the cavern-mountain across the city,\\r\\na blue-white shaft of light sprang into the sky. The Bas saw it and\\r\\nstared. And then suddenly the air seemed to be bursting with\\r\\nvoices—four words, repeated by the audible radio that the cavern was\\r\\nsending out.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"<i>Death to disloyal Bas! Death to disloyal Bas!</i>\"</p>\\r\\n<p>A million aerial voices were proclaiming it everywhere. And then the\\r\\nwords changed.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"<i>We must win against Toroh! The Bas must help us win against Toroh!</i>\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The threat and its so swiftly following appeal were irresistible.\\r\\nMogruud shouted an enthusiastic answer to Fahn, and the crowd applauded.</p>\\r\\n<p>The voices in the air were presently stilled; the light over the cavern\\r\\ndisappeared. And, still with his hands quietly on the parapet, Fahn\\r\\nagain addressed the people below him.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Mogruud says the laws should be changed,\" Loto whispered swiftly to his\\r\\nfather. \"The Bas women should have their children without exile.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Fahn seemed to make a sudden decision. He spoke again into his\\r\\nmouthpiece. Again the light sprang over the cavern. From the air came\\r\\nthe words:</p>\\r\\n<p>\"<i>Bas women will not be exiled! Bas children will be free!</i>\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Surprised, awed, then frantic with joy, the crowd in the<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_113\">[Pg 113]</a></span> palace gardens\\r\\ntook up the cry, and all over the island the radio voices were\\r\\nproclaiming it:</p>\\r\\n<p>\"<i>Bas children will be free! The Scientists promise Bas children will be\\r\\nfree!</i>\"</p>\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 65%;\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER ELEVEN</h2>\\r\\n<p>Still side by side, George and Dee rode back toward Anglese City. It was\\r\\nfurther than George had thought; then he realized that the girl had\\r\\nturned into a different road. He shouted a question at her.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"A shorter way to the cavern,\" she explained.</p>\\r\\n<p>The wind whistling past them made conversation difficult. George\\r\\nunderstood that they were skirting the city to where the cavern stood on\\r\\nthe other side. They were still in the open country; a road of white\\r\\nsand, palm lined, with a forest jungle all around, and only an\\r\\noccasional house.</p>\\r\\n<p>George\\'s mind was in a turmoil. Toroh taking the other plane into time!\\r\\nMemory came to him of all those greater civilizations he and Rogers had\\r\\nseen though the centuries they had passed. Toroh was going back to those\\r\\ncivilizations to secure weapons! The thought turned George cold all\\r\\nover. With the weapons from former, greater ages, Toroh and his army of\\r\\nNoths would be invincible.</p>\\r\\n<p>Words in the wind sweeping by startled George into sudden alertness.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"<i>Death to disloyal Bas!</i>\"</p>\\r\\n<p>It seemed as though some tiny voice had whispered it to him.</p>\\r\\n<p>Dee had checked both the dogs abruptly.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"What\\'s that?\" George demanded.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_114\">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>It came again:</p>\\r\\n<p>\"<i>Death to disloyal Bas! Death to disloyal Bas!</i>\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The air was whispering it, then calling it; a myriad voices echoed it\\r\\neverywhere.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Look there!\" cried Dee.</p>\\r\\n<p>Ahead of them, a mile or so away, a blue light was standing up into the\\r\\nsky. There was a house near at hand, a Bas shack. From it a woman and\\r\\ntwo naked children came running out into the moonlight, panic-stricken\\r\\nat the dread words with which the air resounded.</p>\\r\\n<p>And then the words changed:</p>\\r\\n<p>\"<i>Bas women will not be exiled! Bas children will be free!</i>\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The woman in front of the shack clutched her children, listening,\\r\\nrejoicing—almost unbelieving.</p>\\r\\n<p>Dee had started the dogs forward again. Swiftly she explained to George\\r\\nwhat she thought it might mean—a radio proclamation from Fahn. In a few\\r\\nmoments the light over the cavern had vanished; the voices in the air\\r\\ndied away.</p>\\r\\n<p>George\\'s mind reverted to their own situation; the incident had given\\r\\nhim an idea.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Dee, where are Azeela and Toroh now?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>She thought an instant; momentarily the mental bond with her sister had\\r\\nbeen broken.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Very near Orleen, she thinks. They have heard the voices. Toroh is very\\r\\nangry. He had hoped much that the Bas would rebel. It would have helped\\r\\nhim.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Near Orleen!\" George echoed. \"Can\\'t we get to the Anglese Cavern\\r\\nfirst?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I think so.\" She had started Rotan into a run, but George called her to\\r\\nstop. Even at the risk of losing more precious time, he questioned her.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Dee, listen. Are the caverns of Orleen and Anglese City connected by\\r\\nradio?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes,\" she said.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Then listen. We\\'ll get to Anglese City first and tell them to inform\\r\\nthe guards at Orleen. When Toroh and Azeela arrive they can seize\\r\\nthem—if we warn them ahead.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>She nodded with instant comprehension.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_115\">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>\"All radio isn\\'t broadcast audibly, is it?\" he added.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"No,\" she said. The dogs were running faster. She called back over her\\r\\nshoulder. \"We\\'ll do that. I\\'ll tell Azeela.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>They swept forward, the dogs settling low to the ground as they ran.</p>\\r\\n<p>A great weight seemed to have lifted from George. It would be simple\\r\\nenough, after all—merely notify the Orleen Cavern by radio, and Toroh\\r\\nwould be seized when he presented himself with Azeela.</p>\\r\\n<p>George contemplated the outcome. With Toroh in their hands, the Noth\\r\\nattack would collapse. There would be no war.</p>\\r\\n<p>It was a race then; the only thing that could go wrong would be if Toroh\\r\\ngot to the other cavern first. Rotan and Dee were ahead; the girl\\'s\\r\\nslight figure clinging to the dog showed in the moonlight. George\\r\\nwhispered to Atal, thumped the dog\\'s flank with his hand.</p>\\r\\n<p>As they caught up with Dee, he shouted, \"Where\\'s Azeela now? Will we\\r\\nmake it?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes,\" she answered. \"I think so.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The mountain that housed the cavern loomed ahead through the palms;\\r\\nhouses lay to the right, the outskirts of Anglese City. Half a mile more\\r\\nand they would be there.</p>\\r\\n<p>Atal\\'s upflung head brought George out of another reverie. The dog,\\r\\nstill running at full speed, was sniffing the air. George heard Rotan\\r\\ngrowl, and Dee\\'s sharp command for silence.</p>\\r\\n<p>Another command from the girl, and both dogs stopped; Atal slid on his\\r\\nhaunches, checking himself so abruptly that George was flung to the\\r\\nsand.</p>\\r\\n<p>He was unhurt. He picked himself up to find Dee beside him.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Someone is coming,\" she said sharply. \"Someone the dogs know is not a\\r\\nfriend.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>She spoke to the dog, and pulled George to the side of the road where a\\r\\ncluster of banana trees cast an inky shadow. Together they stood there\\r\\nin silence. Atal and Rotan had disappeared. The road was a white ribbon\\r\\nin the moon<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_116\">[Pg 116]</a></span>light. George listened, but could hear nothing. He tried to\\r\\nquestion Dee, but she silenced him.</p>\\r\\n<p>Presently there came the thud of running feet; from the direction of\\r\\nAnglese City two running dogs with riders swept into view. The riders\\r\\nwere men, black cloaked and wearing masks. Arans, from the festival,\\r\\nGeorge thought.</p>\\r\\n<p>They would have passed without seeing the lurking figures under the\\r\\nbanana trees had not Atal and Rotan, in spite of Dee\\'s command, suddenly\\r\\ncharged them from the shadows across the road.</p>\\r\\n<p>The two men, shouting in anger and alarm, tumbled from their mounts. The\\r\\nfour dogs tangled in a snarling, biting mass.</p>\\r\\n<p>Still George and Dee were unseen in the shadows. One of the men in the\\r\\nroad had lost his cloak and mask; the moonlight showed his face.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"One of Toroh\\'s brothers,\" Dee breathed into George\\'s ear. In the\\r\\ndimness he could see she was raising the small, crescent-shaped weapon.\\r\\nSome noise that she or George made must have alarmed the men, who were\\r\\nno more than ten feet away. They looked sharply across the road, and\\r\\nthen, evidently seeing nothing, they turned back to where the dogs were\\r\\nstill fighting with a deadly fury.</p>\\r\\n<p>Sparks leaped suddenly from Dee\\'s outstretched hand. The men turned. One\\r\\nof them cried out in terror, but they both stood stiff and motionless.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"We\\'ve got \\'em!\" George shouted. \"Good work, Dee!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He would have leaped forward, but her free hand gripped him.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"<i>Quick! The globe!</i>\"</p>\\r\\n<p>One of the men, supposedly stricken beyond the power to move, was, by\\r\\nsome superhuman effort of will, slowly raising his hand; his fingers\\r\\nclutched a tiny black globe. It came up very slowly, as his almost\\r\\nparalyzed muscles struggled with its weight.</p>\\r\\n<p>But George recovered his wits. He snatched his own globe from his\\r\\npocket, pointed it, pulled the trigger.</p>\\r\\n<p>The night was split by a flash, a tiny, sizzling snap of<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_117\">[Pg 117]</a></span> thunder; the\\r\\nglobe recoiled in George\\'s hand. Across the road the bodies of the two\\r\\nmen lay motionless on the sand.</p>\\r\\n<p>Dee was leaning against a banana trunk panting. Her face had gone white,\\r\\nbut she smiled as George turned to her.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"They almost got us,\" she said.</p>\\r\\n<p>George himself was trembling, but he would not let her see it.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Almost, Dee. Next time I\\'ll be ready. I didn\\'t realize...\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Among the trees across the road the dogs were still fighting. One of the\\r\\nNoth dogs lay motionless, torn and bleeding. Atal and Rotan together\\r\\nwere attacking the other—the three rolling and tumbling as they bit and\\r\\ntore at each other, their huge bodies trampling down the banana trees as\\r\\nthey fought.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Dee, could I use the thunderbolt on them?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>She shook her head. \"Wait.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>It lasted only a moment more; the second Noth dog was down, with Atal\\'s\\r\\nfangs buried in its throat.</p>\\r\\n<p>The two dogs came leaping back to their mistress, their bodies torn, and\\r\\nmatted with dirt and blood.</p>\\r\\n<p>Dee patted them affectionately as they stood licking their wounds. \"But\\r\\nyou should have minded me,\" she said.</p>\\r\\n<p>George had taken one look at the two charred figures lying in the road;\\r\\nhe drew the girl away.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Come on. I wouldn\\'t look over there. We must hurry, Dee.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>They mounted the dogs and started forward, more slowly this time, for\\r\\nthe animals carried them with difficulty.</p>\\r\\n<p>Again George remembered. Toroh would be at the Orleen Cavern by this\\r\\ntime. They had lost! This delay had been the one unexpected thing that\\r\\ncould defeat them.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Dee—\"</p>\\r\\n<p>But the girl had anticipated him.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"They are in the plane.\" She half whispered the words. \"Azeela has been\\r\\ntrying to tell me for a long time. Toroh had a spy at the cavern\\r\\nentrance, a man whom we trust as a Scientist. He let them in—Azeela had\\r\\nno chance to make an outcry. They are in the plane now. Azeela telling\\r\\nToroh<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_118\">[Pg 118]</a></span> she cannot operate it. Wait! Now he\\'s trying the proton switch\\r\\nhimself.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>A silence.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Dee! What is it?\" George pleaded.</p>\\r\\n<p>She shook her head. \"Nothing comes. Nothing!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The connection was broken! Azeela was carried back into time. Had\\r\\nsomething stopped her message? Would her thought-bond with her sister\\r\\nhold across the centuries that now separated them?</p>\\r\\n<p>George could only ask himself these questions with a sinking heart. If\\r\\nthe bond would not hold, then Azeela was lost to them forever. Lost to\\r\\nLoto, who loved her. And Toroh would get his weapons and win the\\r\\nwar—<i>inevitably</i>.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Nothing yet, Dee?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"No.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>They rode slowly onward. At last Dee gave a cry of joy.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"It comes again! She is all right, George! <i>All right!</i>\" Her voice rose\\r\\nin triumph and thankfulness.</p>\\r\\n<p>George thumped Atal to urge the dog forward. \"Then we must hurry, Dee.\\r\\nThey\\'re going back into time?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes. Azeela is looking at the dials. Twenty-five years back now. She\\r\\ntells us to hurry. She will watch the dials and let me know where they\\r\\nare. Toroh does not suspect anything. He is gloating. He thinks he has\\r\\nwon everything.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>At last they were ascending the slope to the mouth of the cavern. The\\r\\nyawning hole showed black in the face of the cliff. On the small\\r\\nplatform above the mouth, a single light disclosed the figures of three\\r\\nguards sitting there.</p>\\r\\n<p>In the moonlight the guards saw them coming. A bolt of lightning flashed\\r\\ndownward across the black hole; a peal of thunder rolled out.</p>\\r\\n<p>They stopped, and Dee called to the guards. One of them descended from\\r\\nthe platform, down a narrow flight of steps cut in the cliff face. He\\r\\ncame forward in the moonlight, a black robed figure.</p>\\r\\n<p>Dee spoke with him, and, recognizing a daughter of Fahn, he saluted\\r\\nrespectfully. There followed a brief colloquy, then the guard stood\\r\\naside.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_119\">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>A moment later they were in the cavern. The huge tunnel was dark and\\r\\ndank, but blue-white lights glimmered ahead in the darkness. The place\\r\\nwas silent, seemingly deserted.</p>\\r\\n<p>Down the length of the main tunnel they hurried. The plane stood there\\r\\nin the open space, in the glare of blue-white light. They stood before\\r\\nit.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Dee, shall we send for your father?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>She hesitated.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Where is he?\" George persisted. \"Did you ask the guard?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes. He and Loto and Loto\\'s father are at the palace. There has been\\r\\nrebellion and murder—the murder of Helene, Mme. Voluptua.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>She recounted succinctly the events of the night in Anglese City as the\\r\\nguard had told them to her.</p>\\r\\n<p>George whistled. \"They\\'ve got their hands full. Dee, are you still in\\r\\ncommunication with Azeela?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes. They are beyond fifty years.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Going how fast?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Azeela says as fast as they can—the twentieth intensity.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>George made his decision.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Dee, we mustn\\'t wait, mustn\\'t stop for anything. You\\'re willing to go?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes,\" she declared soberly.</p>\\r\\n<p>She reached toward the platform. George locked his hands, and she put\\r\\nher small foot into them. He lifted her—she seemed no heavier than a\\r\\nchild—and she swung herself up gracefully and easily to the platform.</p>\\r\\n<p>George followed and closed the cabin door after them. \"Did you tell the\\r\\nguard what we were going to do?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes,\" she said. \"I told him to tell father later tonight when things\\r\\nwere more quiet at the palace.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Good girl. Dee, have you ever been back into time?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"No. Azeela has. Just a little way—with Loto. He taught her to operate\\r\\nthe plane.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"How fast are they going, Dee? The twentieth intensity?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>George\\'s hand was on the proton switch. He took a last look around.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_120\">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>\"Sit down, Dee. Hold the arms of your chair. Don\\'t be frightened.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The cabin was dark; through its windows the blue-white glare outside\\r\\nshowed the jagged brown walls of the cavern. The twentieth intensity!\\r\\n<i>Toroh was going as fast as he possibly could!</i></p>\\r\\n<p>George pulled the switch. There was a soundless clap in his head; a\\r\\nplunge, headlong into some bottomless abyss, falling for hours—an\\r\\neternity.</p>\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 45%;\">\\r\\n<p>Fahn\\'s proclamation to the Bas had far-reaching effects. All over the\\r\\nisland that night and the next day there was rejoicing. The radio\\r\\nproclaimed a national holiday, which the Bas gave over to festivities.</p>\\r\\n<p>The murder of Mme. Voluptua was forgotten; the rebellion in Anglese City\\r\\nwas a thing of the past. The work of Toroh\\'s spies was completely\\r\\nundone; everywhere they presented themselves they were seized by the Bas\\r\\nand delivered to the authorities, until by mid-morning none dared show\\r\\nhimself. They remained in hiding in the mountains, and the following\\r\\nnight fled the island.</p>\\r\\n<p>Fahn\\'s object had been attained. Everywhere, enthusiasm for the war soon\\r\\nmounted to a patriotic frenzy.</p>\\r\\n<p>But it was not all smooth sailing for Fahn. Within an hour after the\\r\\nfirst radio proclamation—just before dawn that day—the king called the\\r\\nScientist to his audience room and demanded that it be retracted. For\\r\\nthe first time within generations, a Scientist defied his king.</p>\\r\\n<p>Fahn gravely refused. The king, with his councilors—brave now since the\\r\\nmob before the palace had dispersed—clustered around him, vigorously\\r\\ntried to overawe the Scientist. But Fahn was obdurate; respectful to the\\r\\nmajesty of royalty—but obdurate nevertheless.</p>\\r\\n<p>The king was powerless, and he knew it. He raged, threatened, but to no\\r\\navail.</p>\\r\\n<p>That afternoon the king\\'s council met. The Scientists were declared\\r\\noutlaws; a call was issued for the Aran police,<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_121\">[Pg 121]</a></span> who were scattered\\r\\nthroughout the island, to come at once to the Anglese City to defend\\r\\ntheir sovereign.</p>\\r\\n<p>It was a monarch struggling against all reason to defend what he\\r\\nconsidered his birthright. Royalty outraged!</p>\\r\\n<p>But the Aran police did not come. Worse than that, those near at hand in\\r\\nAnglese City prudently vanished.</p>\\r\\n<p>That same afternoon the Scientists met in Anglese City. Fahn\\'s action\\r\\nwas upheld, and from other cities came similar decisions. The government\\r\\nwas taken over by the Scientists for the period of the war. Laws\\r\\nratifying the new status of the Bas women and children were hurriedly\\r\\npassed, and made permanent.</p>\\r\\n<p>All that day the radio audibly proclaimed events as they transpired. The\\r\\nArans were not to be molested; their relations with the Bas were to\\r\\nproceed as always, and the royal family was to be treated with the\\r\\noutward respect to which its birth and position entitled it.</p>\\r\\n<p>Three days passed—days that for those in Anglese City were full of\\r\\nactivity and anxiety. The Arans kept sullenly to themselves; the king\\r\\nand his councilors shut themselves in the palace; the Bas went about\\r\\ntheir accustomed tasks feverishly, abstractedly, waiting for the call to\\r\\nwar.</p>\\r\\n<p>The Scientists, trusting nothing to chance, sought out all the Aran\\r\\npolice and disarmed them. All weapons were kept in the caverns, where\\r\\nthe manufacturing and assembling went steadily forward.</p>\\r\\n<p>Fahn, Loto, and Rogers, during these three days, stayed at Fahn\\'s home.\\r\\nNothing had been heard from George and the two girls. They were days\\r\\nfull of anxiety—almost despair—for the three men. The guards at the\\r\\ntwo caverns reported what had happened. Fahn cursed his inefficiency in\\r\\nallowing a Toroh spy to remain unsuspected in the League. The man who\\r\\nhad given Toroh the plane was located and put to death, but that helped\\r\\nmatters little.</p>\\r\\n<p>In the brief interims of inactivity, the three men discussed what George\\r\\nand Dee might be doing—what the outcome would be. The discussions were\\r\\nfutile; there was nothing to do but wait.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_122\">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>The character of the two Frazia planes, the identity of the visitors,\\r\\nhad never been made public. Only Fahn, his two companions and a few of\\r\\nthe Scientist leaders were aware of the momentous outcome for which they\\r\\nwere so helplessly waiting.</p>\\r\\n<p>On the afternoon of the third day, Fahn took Loto and his father through\\r\\nthe cavern. Loto was pale and tight-lipped, but he seldom mentioned\\r\\nAzeela, and never once had he given vent to his feelings. Rogers was\\r\\ncurious to see the cavern; older, more philosophical than Loto, he could\\r\\nbetter withstand his anxiety over George and the girls. Yet he, too, was\\r\\nmore worried than he would have cared to admit, even to himself. The\\r\\nwar—the fate of the Anglese—was one thing; but that plane was all that\\r\\ncould take him back to Lylda, his wife. He could probably never\\r\\nmanufacture another plane in this time world; the materials were not\\r\\navailable. He realized now how wrong he had been not to bring Lylda with\\r\\nhim.</p>\\r\\n<p>It was late afternoon when they started. Work in the cavern now\\r\\nproceeded day and night.</p>\\r\\n<p>To Rogers the place was one of romantic mystery, with a sinister air to\\r\\nit that he could not shake off.</p>\\r\\n<p>The darkness of the cavern walls, the shadows, the flickering blue\\r\\nlights, and the yawning holes with which the interior of the mountain\\r\\nseemed honeycombed, awed and perturbed him.</p>\\r\\n<p>Far ahead, down a sharp slope, two blue lights shone. To the left a\\r\\npassageway glowed dull red.</p>\\r\\n<p>Fahn turned toward it. They went into the passageway, and from it\\r\\nemerged upon a narrow ledge with a metal railing. Before them spread a\\r\\nhuge pit, a great pool of lava a thousand feet down—lava that boiled\\r\\nsluggishly, with tiny flames of burning gases licking upward from its\\r\\nsurface. To one side, overhead, a rift through the mountain showed a\\r\\npatch of starlit sky.</p>\\r\\n<p>Visitors to an inferno, they stood clinging to the iron rail. The lurid\\r\\nred light cast monstrous shadows of their figures upward to the rocky\\r\\nceiling. The sulphurous air was in<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_123\">[Pg 123]</a></span>tolerably hot; it choked their\\r\\nbreathing. After a moment they all stumbled back into the passageway,\\r\\ncoughing, breathing deep of the purer air.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Fires of the earth so close!\" murmured Rogers.</p>\\r\\n<p>Fahn was leading them forward again. \"Yes, almost every mountain on the\\r\\nisland is like that. The fires are even closer to the surface at Orleen;\\r\\nwe use them in the cavern there.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"And here is a room of medicine and surgery,\" he added. He had turned\\r\\nunexpectedly into a side cave, a room furnished and draped, and dimly\\r\\nlighted by braziers hanging from its low roof. Rows of bottles, cases of\\r\\ninstruments, a long, low table, littered with a variety of strange\\r\\nobjects; the room held a confusion of things, most of which were\\r\\nincomprehensible.</p>\\r\\n<p>Something made Rogers shudder. \"What is that?\" he demanded.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"To create human life,\" said Fahn. \"For thousands of years, science has\\r\\ntried to do that. We can make a man\\'s body—but his soul and mind still\\r\\nelude us.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Rogers was staring at a metal framework, where the organs of a man were\\r\\nhanging, joined together and with a network of blood vessels around\\r\\nthem; the fundamental, simplified mechanism of man, without the body.\\r\\nAnd there was movement to the organs; the heart was beating, the lungs\\r\\nbreathing.</p>\\r\\n<p>It was gruesome; it made Rogers\\' gorge rise.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"They will function for a little time,\" Fahn explained. \"But our\\r\\nsurgeons have done better than that. They have made the living body—all\\r\\nbut the mind and the soul.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>A small case was standing on a pedestal, illuminated by a dim blue light\\r\\nabove it. A lump of living human flesh lay within, roughly fashioned\\r\\ninto human form, with arms and legs that kicked.</p>\\r\\n<p>Rogers backed away.</p>\\r\\n<p>It seemed like a dream, this trip through the Scientists\\' cavern. From\\r\\none room to another they wandered. Most of the caves were unoccupied;\\r\\noccasionally a lone worker<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_124\">[Pg 124]</a></span> or a group would stop their tasks\\r\\nmomentarily to meet their leader and his visitors.</p>\\r\\n<p>From far away recesses, where the main work was going on, the hum of\\r\\ndynamos sounded.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"We will not go into the workrooms tonight,\" Fahn said. \"I\\'ll show them\\r\\nto you later.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>They entered another inner cave, which was high-arched and unusually\\r\\nlarge. It held relics of bygone ages. Broken mechanisms, that\\r\\ninhabitants of other planets might have left on earth, had been dug\\r\\nup and stored here as in a museum. They meant nothing to Rogers, nor\\r\\ndid Fahn offer to explain them. But this room more than any other in\\r\\nthe cavern seemed to carry with it the power of science, the greater\\r\\nscience that to Fahn\\'s time world was in the prehistoric past. It\\r\\nshowed Fahn and his contemporaries in their true light; they were\\r\\narchaeologists—imitators, reconstructors, not real creators.</p>\\r\\n<p>At last they reached a circular room equipped with the apparatus for\\r\\ntaking voices and images from the air. Its side walls were paneled with\\r\\nhuge crystals that mirrored distant scenes; and it was filled with\\r\\nmillions of tiny voices.</p>\\r\\n<p>Fahn stood before one of the crystals: his hand was on a lever; the\\r\\nfingers of his other hand rested on a tiny row of buttons. Rogers\\r\\nnoticed that there were scores of similar mechanisms dispersed about the\\r\\nroom.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Let us look and listen, a mile away to the west,\" Fahn said.</p>\\r\\n<p>The crystal before them was some six feet square. It was gray and\\r\\ncloudy. Fahn pressed one of the small black buttons, and moved the lever\\r\\nover a notch; the crystal flooded with color. It was like looking\\r\\nthrough a huge window.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"The viewpoint of our station a mile north of here,\" Fahn pointed out.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"A thirty foot tower,\" Loto explained. \"The lens on it swings in a\\r\\ncircle. We are looking westward now toward Orleen.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The scene in the crystal showed the red western sky; a white road in the\\r\\nforeground, disappearing seemingly at<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_125\">[Pg 125]</a></span> Rogers\\' feet; the green,\\r\\npalm-dotted island, with twilight shadows creeping upon it, and to the\\r\\nleft, the island mountain range, its peaks rising in serrated ranks,\\r\\nwith giant, snow-clad summits.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"It was near here that day before yesterday they found the charred\\r\\nbodies of Toroh\\'s brother and his Noth companion,\" Loto added. \"A Bas\\r\\nwoman—see that shack there by the road—she saw a girl and a man\\r\\npassing the night before. It may have been George and Dee.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The shack at the roadside showed plainly. A Bas woman was sitting at its\\r\\ndoorway, crooning to her infant. Her voice sounded almost as clearly as\\r\\nthough the watchers had been sitting on the small tower where the lens\\r\\nand radio mechanism were perched.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"We will turn,\" Fahn said.</p>\\r\\n<p>A panorama unfolding, the scene moved slowly sidewise: the sea to the\\r\\nnorth, with the mountain range beyond it, dim in the gathering darkness;\\r\\neast, back toward Anglese City, where the cavern-mountain itself showed\\r\\nbehind the palms; to the south past a distant vista of city houses; and\\r\\nstill swinging, it came back to the road and the house and stopped,\\r\\nagain facing the west.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Another station,\" Fahn added.</p>\\r\\n<p>The crystal-face went dark, and then relighted. It was a viewpoint of a\\r\\nhundred feet in the air this time. Again it swung the points of the\\r\\ncompass.</p>\\r\\n<p>For half an hour Fahn continued his demonstration. There might have been\\r\\na hundred or more towers scattered over the island, and the scene from\\r\\nany one of them sprang at Fahn\\'s will into the crystal window.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"What are the other crystal mirrors for?\" Rogers asked Loto.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"The island can be searched by several operators simultaneously. Any\\r\\nviewpoint may be thrown into any crystal, and there are receivers for\\r\\nyour ears, so that the sounds you hear will not confuse others in the\\r\\nroom.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The island was growing dark. The crystal showed a viewpoint from the\\r\\nchannel coast halfway to Orleen. It must have<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_126\">[Pg 126]</a></span> been from a very high\\r\\ntower; the sea stretched several hundred feet beneath.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Those mountains across the water,\" Rogers remarked, \"can\\'t be over\\r\\ntwenty or thirty miles from our shores. Is that where Toroh\\'s army will\\r\\ngather?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"From behind them,\" said Loto. \"To the east, nearer the Atlantic Coast,\\r\\nwe think. We—\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Fahn had given a slight cry. The room was dark, but the reflected light\\r\\nfrom the crystal showed the Scientist pointing into the mirrored scene.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Loto, what is that?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Above the mountains across the channel, the sky was rose-colored with\\r\\nthe fading daylight. A tiny gray shape showed there, silhouetted against\\r\\nthe clouds. It was moving. They watched it, breathlessly.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"A Frazia plane!\" Rogers murmured.</p>\\r\\n<p>It circled like a giant bird. A patch of lighter sky behind showed it\\r\\nmore plainly after a moment. It <i>was</i> a Frazia plane! It was closer than\\r\\nthey had thought, but it seemed to be flying north, away from them.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Which one is it?\" Loto whispered. \"Father, which one is it?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>But that they could not tell. George, or Toroh? One of them had\\r\\nreturned. The plane was flying lower, circling again. The dimness\\r\\nabsorbed it; then it reappeared. It seemed now to be flying crazily.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"<i>Out of control!</i>\" Loto whispered in horror. \"<i>It\\'s falling!</i>\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The plane turned over, fluttered down, was swallowed by the shadows of\\r\\nthe distant mountains.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_127\">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 65%;\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER TWELVE</h2>\\r\\n<p>The interior of the plane was glowing. The familiar humming sounded.\\r\\nGeorge and Dee had started back into time.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Dee! Dee! You all right?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Her wan smile reassured him. \"Where are we?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Going back into time,\" he said cheerfully. The dials were beside him.\\r\\n\"Nearly forty years from where we started already. You\\'ll feel all right\\r\\nsoon.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I am all right,\" she persisted. \"I mean, George, are we still in the\\r\\ncavern?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The question brought an idea to George that made his heart race. They\\r\\n<i>were</i> still in the cavern, at a time forty years previous. What was the\\r\\ncavern like then? Suppose its entrance was closed? How could they get\\r\\nout?</p>\\r\\n<p>Through the windows nothing could be seen but blackness. George\\r\\nhesitated.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Dee, can your thoughts still reach Azeela?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes,\" she said. \"She was frightened for me. She knows now we are coming\\r\\nafter her. She and Toroh are past one hundred years.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Still going?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Where are they in space?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"She says in the air, over the Orleen Cavern. She thought it best to\\r\\nshow Toroh how to fly the plane; she was afraid to remain underground.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"So am I,\" said George. \"We\\'d better get out.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>There were headlights on the plane; their glare showed the tunnel.\\r\\nGeorge started up the Frazia motors, slowly;<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_128\">[Pg 128]</a></span> they rolled forward,\\r\\nfaster as they left the tunnel-mouth and took to the air.</p>\\r\\n<p>The scene was that familiar grayness, new to Dee. Beneath them lay the\\r\\nisland with the blurred, gray city to one side.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Over Orleen,\" George mused. \"We must get there quickly. Further back in\\r\\ntime the city will not be there—we might get lost in space.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>At an altitude of perhaps a thousand feet they flew swiftly westward.\\r\\nOrleen was there when they reached its space; the dials were beyond two\\r\\nhundred years.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Azeela is here,\" Dee announced. \"She says the city is dwindling.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"What do her dials say? Will Toroh let her look at them?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes. She is very careful. He suspects nothing. She says the dials are\\r\\nnearly two hundred and thirty years.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"We\\'re catching up with them,\" George exclaimed triumphantly. \"We\\'ve got\\r\\nthe faster plane. Where are they exactly? In space I mean.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>A brief pause.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Azeela says almost directly over the peak near the east edge of the\\r\\ncity—the cavern peak.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>There were twin peaks, not over six hundred feet apart. The cavern peak\\r\\nwas the northern one; through the floor window, George could see the\\r\\nsummit of the other, directly beneath his plane.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"How high is Toroh? They\\'re using the \\'copters?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"How high up?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"She says about five hundred feet.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>It was the altitude at which George and Dee were hovering. George gazed\\r\\nthrough the side window. The other peak showed plainly. Above it was the\\r\\nexact space Toroh and Azeela were occupying. Their plane was invisible,\\r\\nof course—twenty-five years into the past.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"They\\'ve passed three hundred years, George,\" the girl\\'s voice informed\\r\\nhim. \"Three hundred years just now.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Two hundred and ninety,\" he read from their own dials.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_129\">[Pg 129]</a></span> \"Only ten years\\r\\naway! We\\'ll overtake them shortly now.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>In the stress through which they had passed, and their excitement,\\r\\nneither of them had considered what they would do when they overtook\\r\\nToroh. Indeed, it was Azeela who brought it to their minds with her\\r\\nanxious questions to Dee.</p>\\r\\n<p>They stared at each other in dismay.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"How about my thunderbolt glove?\" George suggested.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"We can\\'t use it,\" she reminded him. \"If we destroy the other plane,\\r\\nAzeela would be killed.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>It was obvious. They could not attack the other plane under any\\r\\ncircumstances. But Toroh was going to stop for weapons. They would have\\r\\nto stay near him, both in space and time, and when he stopped, and\\r\\nperhaps left the plane, they would rush up and rescue Azeela.</p>\\r\\n<p>It was all either of them could plan.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Keep as near them as we can,\" George decided. \"That\\'s the idea. And\\r\\nwatch our chance. Tell Azeela to keep you posted on everything.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>They slowed their time-flight a trifle; it would have been foolish to\\r\\nlet Toroh see them—merely put him on his guard. At a distance of about\\r\\nten years they followed.</p>\\r\\n<p>At eight hundred years before the time they had left, the city of Orleen\\r\\nhad disappeared. The island looked almost the same; the peaks were still\\r\\nthere. But now among the palms there were only a few rude shacks—the\\r\\nearliest Bas settlers.</p>\\r\\n<p>The time-velocity of both planes was steadily increasing. Azeela\\'s\\r\\nmessages told them that the other plane was still hovering motionless.\\r\\nThere was nothing to do. They waited, anxiously at first, and then,\\r\\nafter an interval, fell into earnest conversation.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Suppose we can\\'t rescue Azeela,\" George suggested once. \"Toroh will use\\r\\nher as a hostage against your father, won\\'t he? Offer her life, perhaps,\\r\\nif your father will help him in the war?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>She nodded soberly.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"That\\'s why he abducted her before, Loto said. Did he make the offer\\r\\nthen?\"<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_130\">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>\"No. But he was going to.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Why didn\\'t you go after her?\" he suggested. \"Didn\\'t she send back\\r\\nmessages to you, Dee?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes. But he took her north into the snow. She did not know where she\\r\\nwas. Father sent out an expedition, but they couldn\\'t find her. The\\r\\nNoths attacked them and they came back. They were going to start out\\r\\nagain when Loto returned her to us.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Oh,\" said George. He thought a moment. \"I wonder what your father would\\r\\nhave done—what he would do now if Toroh holds Azeela and offers her\\r\\nlife against the war. Would your father let Toroh kill her?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>She hesitated. \"I think he would,\" she said at last. \"It would be a\\r\\nnation against one life. He would sacrifice himself, I know. And I think\\r\\nhe would even sacrifice Azeela.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>George met her earnest dark eyes, so sparkling, usually, but now so\\r\\nsombre.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Would you, Dee?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"No,\" she said impulsively.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Neither would I,\" he declared. \"I wouldn\\'t let harm come to Azeela for\\r\\nall the Anglese,—or harm to—to you, either.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>She did not answer. Presently he said:</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I was thinking about that Aran Festival, Dee. You know you oughtn\\'t to\\r\\ngo to affairs like that. <i>Do</i> you know it?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Her gaze met his again, questioningly. \"It is part of life,\" she said.\\r\\n\"My father thinks Azeela and I should know what life is. In your\\r\\ntime-world was it wrong?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>George felt himself flushing. \"Wrong? What, the festival?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"No. I mean my going there—a girl of the Scientists, who is not like\\r\\nthe Aran women?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes,\" George said stoutly. \"<i>I</i> didn\\'t want you to be there.\" His hand\\r\\nimpulsively touched hers. \"I didn\\'t like it, Dee. You\\'re too nice a\\r\\ngirl. And I don\\'t think Loto liked Azeela being there, either.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Instead of answering, she gave a sudden cry.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"What is it?\" George demanded in alarm.</p>\\r\\n<p>She had no opportunity to reply. Through the side win<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_131\">[Pg 131]</a></span>dow the other\\r\\nplane showed less than a thousand feet away; a shimmering ghost that was\\r\\ngone as soon as they had seen it!</p>\\r\\n<p>George leaped to the proton switch, but Dee checked him.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Wait! Wait till Azeela tells me what happened.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>In the absorption of their conversation, Azeela\\'s messages had been\\r\\nignored. Toroh had slackened his time-flight; he was preparing to land.\\r\\nIt was an unfortunate occurrence, for Toroh had seen the other plane. He\\r\\nstill did not guess that Azeela herself was guiding the pursuit.</p>\\r\\n<p>Again, without warning, the other plane appeared. This time it was\\r\\nflying, coming directly toward them. George held his breath. Toroh\\'s\\r\\nplane was so close he had no opportunity even to move from his seat. It\\r\\nwas running level with them in time; <i>it was charging them! Had Toroh\\r\\ngone mad? He would kill them all!</i></p>\\r\\n<p>It was no more than a second or two. Through the window George caught a\\r\\nbrief glimpse of the shimmering thing rushing at them. Then it swerved\\r\\nupward.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"<i>He\\'s going to fire a thunderbolt!</i>\" Dee gasped.</p>\\r\\n<p>George was aware of a flash; but he had not seen it, only imagined it.</p>\\r\\n<p>The attacking plane swept overhead and vanished-dissolved into\\r\\nnothingness!</p>\\r\\n<p>Toroh had fired a thunderbolt. The rush of electrons traveling at the\\r\\nspeed of light from Toroh\\'s plane to George\\'s had been too slow. The\\r\\nmark was gone into a different time before the thunderbolt could reach\\r\\nit!</p>\\r\\n<p>The incident left George and Dee shuddering; but confident now that, so\\r\\nlong as they kept moving through time, Toroh could not harm them.</p>\\r\\n<p>George\\'s dials now registered the passage of some sixty-eight hundred\\r\\nyears. He was amazed. Then he realized how long he and his companion had\\r\\nbeen talking, and the time-velocity at the twentieth intensity had been\\r\\naccelerating tremendously. He had forgotten to look beneath him; he did\\r\\nso now, and the island was not there. The channel was gone;<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_132\">[Pg 132]</a></span> the\\r\\nmountain range had disappeared. The cataclysm that had formed the island\\r\\nhad been passed.</p>\\r\\n<p>Azeela\\'s messages told that her plane was now nearly a hundred years\\r\\nnearer the Anglese time-world. Toroh, finding his attack ineffective,\\r\\nhad given it up. He had started a horizontal flight; he was looking for\\r\\na city in which he could land.</p>\\r\\n<p>George and Dee sat helpless, for Azeela could not describe which way she\\r\\nwas flying.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Lost!\" George exclaimed. \"We\\'ve lost them! Of course, she can\\'t tell us\\r\\nwhich way they\\'re going when there\\'s nothing down there but gray\\r\\nforests—and blurred gray sky overhead.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>It seemed probable that they would never see Toroh\\'s plane again.\\r\\nAlready it was many miles away from them in space, though in what\\r\\ndirection they could not guess.</p>\\r\\n<p>The two planes swept back through time, invisible to each other, yet no\\r\\nmore than a few hundred years apart. The rescue of Azeela—for the\\r\\npresent at least—was certainly impossible. Toroh was looking for a\\r\\ncivilization, some gigantic city where he might secure weapons. George\\r\\ndecided he must do the same. He discussed it earnestly with Dee, and\\r\\nagain, temporarily, Azeela\\'s thought messages were ignored.</p>\\r\\n<p>At fifteen thousand years—more than halfway back to the time-world of\\r\\nthe New York City of George\\'s birth—structures began rising out of the\\r\\nforests. By retrograded changes made visible, at first they seemed\\r\\nmoldering ruins; then, broken, neglected areas of deserted cities; then\\r\\nthe inhabited cities themselves.</p>\\r\\n<p>At eighteen thousand years George and Dee were poised no more than a few\\r\\nmiles from where Orleen stood so many centuries later. A huge river with\\r\\na delta emptied into the open gulf; a broad expanse of lake was near by.\\r\\nAnd on both sides of the river and around the lake a gigantic city rose\\r\\nin terraced buildings of masonry and steel. Dee stared in awe at its\\r\\ntowers, bridges, aerial streets with the monorail structures stretching\\r\\nabove.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_133\">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>\"We might land here,\" George suggested. \"Shall we, Dee? You\\'d think\\r\\nthey\\'d have <i>something</i> to help your father in the Anglese war.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>She nodded, and he prepared to land on an open space a few miles north\\r\\nof the city outskirts. They came to the ground at the third intensity of\\r\\nproton current. Everything was gray, soundless.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"All ready, Dee?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He flung over the switch. When the shock had passed, George stood up;\\r\\nDee was already on her feet beside him. It was night outside; lights\\r\\nwere flashing. They rushed to the window. The sky was lurid with\\r\\nbursting colored bombs; an inferno of noise sounded, an intermittent\\r\\npounding that seemed to shake the earth.</p>\\r\\n<p>From-almost directly overhead a red rocket exploded. Its light\\r\\npersisted, illuminating the scene for miles around with a vivid red\\r\\nglare. The giant city buildings were visible. As George stared, a great\\r\\nflame seemed to leap from the sky. One of the buildings fell.</p>\\r\\n<p>Nearer at hand a cloud of swarming mechanisms burst out of the air,\\r\\nswooping down, circling. Beams of light from them and from the city\\r\\ncrossed like swords in the sky. The earth under the plane was rocking.\\r\\nBeside it, a green flash struck and sent rocks, boulders, and dirt\\r\\nflying up like a waterspout.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"George! <i>George!</i>\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Dee\\'s terrified cry in his ear was almost drowned by the scream of\\r\\ndynamos; the whistling, bursting, and pounding.</p>\\r\\n<p>George\\'s trembling fingers found the proton switch; he pulled it. The\\r\\ninferno of the night melted, slipped away into a gray, soundless blur.</p>\\r\\n<p>War! They had fallen into the midst of a battle—that giant Earth city\\r\\ndefending itself, perhaps against invaders from another planet.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"We won\\'t try that again,\" George murmured.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Azeela,\" said the girl suddenly. \"She tells me that Toroh has secured\\r\\nweapons! He is returning to our time-world!\"<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_134\">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>Toroh had landed at another city, in another time, but still in that\\r\\nsame greater civilization. He had chosen a night, bound Azeela, left her\\r\\nin the plane and stolen weapons.</p>\\r\\n<p>George listened blankly. \"What sort of weapons?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Azeela does not know. One large piece of apparatus. He has it in the\\r\\nplane covered by a black bag. He will not let her touch it. And there\\r\\nare other things—a pile of disks or something. White—like steel. She\\r\\ncan\\'t see them well—he has covered them also. He is filled with\\r\\ntriumph. His plane is speeding toward Anglese City.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"In space or time?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"In time. They are hovering in space. Azeela does not know where they\\r\\nare. Toroh says he will wait, and when the time-world of the island is\\r\\nreached they will recognize the land. Then Toroh will take Azeela to the\\r\\nNoths. He says if our father does not yield, he will <i>kill her</i>. And\\r\\nthen he and the Noths will conquer the Anglese.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>George had lost. But still there seemed nothing that they could do but\\r\\ntry and keep as close to the other plane in time as they could.</p>\\r\\n<p>Toroh\\'s plane was sweeping forward. He had released Azeela, commanding\\r\\nher to instruct him in more detail in the handling of the Frazia motors.\\r\\nAzeela\\'s dials now read some fifty-five hundred years behind the Anglese\\r\\ntime-world. George\\'s read about six thousand.</p>\\r\\n<p>They came to the cataclysm that formed the island. George had forgotten\\r\\nit, but he chanced to be gazing down. The gray forests suddenly blurred;\\r\\nvague chaos passed over the earth, the air, and the sky; then there were\\r\\nthe familiar mountains, the channel, the island! The myriad details of\\r\\nthose hours of upheaval had been compressed, blended into a fraction of\\r\\na second. The eye and the mind could not grasp it. The thing was past,\\r\\ndone and away, with only its <i>effect</i> left as evidence that it had\\r\\noccurred.</p>\\r\\n<p>George and Dee were above the channel and west of Orleen. No more than a\\r\\nhundred years now separated the planes.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"What shall we do?\" George demanded for the tenth<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_135\">[Pg 135]</a></span> time. And then an\\r\\nidea came to him. They could not attack Toroh until he reached his\\r\\ndestination. He would be among his own army then, and rescue of Azeela\\r\\nwould be impossible. But if Azeela could separate herself from Toroh\\r\\nnow, he could never find her in time and probably wouldn\\'t try.</p>\\r\\n<p>George explained it to Dee. Azeela was not bound; could she persuade\\r\\nToroh on some pretext to land on the ground—then leap from the plane?\\r\\nThe shock of stopping in time should be no different than when the plane\\r\\nitself stopped.</p>\\r\\n<p>Azeela had already thought of it; the idea had been prompted by the fact\\r\\nthat Toroh\\'s plane was running out of fuel. He would have to conserve\\r\\nit, not use the \\'copters, or else he would have none left with which to\\r\\nget up north.</p>\\r\\n<p>George was trembling with excitement. \"Tell her to suggest that they\\r\\nland.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Toroh was, at that instant, landing. It was a familiar spot to Azeela;\\r\\nshe described it exactly to Dee, and the younger sister recognized it.</p>\\r\\n<p>Toroh\\'s plane had entered the second century before Fahn\\'s time-world\\r\\nwhen George—some fifty years further back—arrived at the spot in space\\r\\nAzeela was describing. There was the little rise of ground, with the\\r\\nchannel beyond. The vegetation was different, but the level rock was\\r\\nthere. And Toroh\\'s plane was resting on that level rock.</p>\\r\\n<p>Dee\\'s voice was shaking so that she could hardly talk. \"Will it—kill\\r\\nher, George?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He was white faced, tense. \"Tell her to read the dials as exactly as she\\r\\ncan.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Azeela read them. George held his watch in his hand; he noted the hour\\r\\nand minute it gave.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"She has called Toroh\\'s attention to something outside,\" Dee\\'s voice\\r\\ntranslated swiftly. \"She opens the cabin door. He is behind her but he\\r\\ndoes not suspect.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>George kept his eyes on his watch. Two minutes since Azeela gave them\\r\\nher dial-reading, and he knew the approximate time-velocity of the other\\r\\nplane.</p>\\r\\n<p>Three minutes!<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_136\">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>\"She is on the platform. The blurred rock is only a few feet below her.\\r\\nAzeela is pretending something is wrong under the plane. Toroh is beside\\r\\nher—but he does not touch her. He does not suspect she would dare....\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Three minutes and a half.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"She jumps—\"</p>\\r\\n<p>George waited. \"Is she all right? Is she all right?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Silence.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Can\\'t you get her? Oh, Dee, can\\'t you get her?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The communication was broken.</p>\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 65%;\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h2>\\r\\n<p>\"It fell,\" Rogers murmured. \"Was that Toroh\\'s plane, or George\\'s?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Loto did not answer; he stared with set face at the crystal mirror,\\r\\nwhich was turning purple with the deepening shadows of nightfall. The\\r\\nmountains into which the plane had fallen were a vague silhouette\\r\\nagainst a sky of stars.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"If we could only see over there,\" Rogers added wistfully. \"Is this\\r\\ntower we\\'re looking from now the nearest to the mountains, Loto?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>It was the nearest. But Fahn was talking swiftly into a small mouthpiece\\r\\nbeside him.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"We may be able to see into the mountains,\" he said in a moment. \"We\\r\\nmust find out which plane it was. Perhaps Toroh fell and was killed.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The anxiety on his face belied the calmness of his tone. His two\\r\\ndaughters were out there; possibly one or both had met death in that\\r\\nfalling plane.</p>\\r\\n<p>A man entered the cave-room hurriedly, a solitary worker<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_137\">[Pg 137]</a></span> whom Fahn had\\r\\nsummoned from another part of the cavern. A youngish man, he wore dark\\r\\nglasses, a black robe and gloves.</p>\\r\\n<p>Fahn questioned him briefly; he brightened, nodded, and hastened away\\r\\nagain.</p>\\r\\n<p>Loto explained: \"He\\'s been working on a new invention, Father. We hoped\\r\\nto use it in the war, but now we fear the attack may come before it\\'s\\r\\nready. There is only one small model constructed—finished today.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The man returned with a small mechanism—a black circular disk, an inch\\r\\nthick and two feet in diameter. On it was mounted a cone-shaped lens a\\r\\nfoot high. It looked something like a tiny model of the lighthouse lens.\\r\\nAn operating mechanism was fastened behind the lens; it was an open box\\r\\nwith tiny coils of wire inside. And near this was what looked like a\\r\\nminiature searchlight.</p>\\r\\n<p>Fahn inspected the apparatus. His assistant made some connections,\\r\\nadjusting another mechanism on the table. Then, turning the disk over\\r\\nand holding it in the air above his head, he released it. The thing\\r\\nfloated, motionless, its lens-tower hanging downward. The small\\r\\nsearchlight also pointed downward and from it a beam of blue-white light\\r\\nstruck the cave-floor with a circle of brilliant illumination.</p>\\r\\n<p>Fahn smiled his approval; the young assistant seemed gratified.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"It\\'s a development of the communication towers, combined with the\\r\\nlevitation dais you saw at the Festival—the apparatus Toroh\\'s brothers\\r\\ntried to steal,\" Loto said to his father.</p>\\r\\n<p>A moment later the young scientist had disappeared with his flying lens,\\r\\ntaking it outside the cavern to release it into the air.</p>\\r\\n<p>Fahn sat at the table with the newly installed mechanism under his\\r\\nfingers. In a few moments the assistant was back, empty-handed; he stood\\r\\nbefore the now blank crystal mirror with the other men, anxiously\\r\\nwatching for the success of his work.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"This was greatly used a few centuries ago,\" Fahn said.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_138\">[Pg 138]</a></span> He sighed. \"Our\\r\\nancestors knew so much; it is so hard to keep up with them.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The crystal mirror presently became illumined. The scene was the\\r\\ndarkness of night; stars reflected moonlight from a moon just outside\\r\\nthe line of vision. Below—a thousand feet, perhaps—a vague palm-dotted\\r\\nlandscape was sliding into view.</p>\\r\\n<p>To the watchers, the illusion was like flying through the night, looking\\r\\ndownward.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I shall light the searchlights,\" Fahn said.</p>\\r\\n<p>A broad circle of blue-white illumination fell upon the shifting land.\\r\\nAcross it, the palms of the island were moving backward. The viewpoint\\r\\nof the whole scene was unsteady. The horizon bobbed up and down, like\\r\\nthe horizon viewed from a plunging ship. The moon showed momentarily,\\r\\nthem swung sidewise out of sight.</p>\\r\\n<p>Soon the channel appeared; the dark mountains were coming nearer; they\\r\\ntilted downward, almost out of sight, as the lens mounted an incline to\\r\\npass above them.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Can we find where the plane fell?\" Loto asked anxiously.</p>\\r\\n<p>Fahn did not answer at once. At last he said: \"It will be difficult. It\\r\\nmay have fallen behind the mountains, or into them. I do not know.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>In the mirror, the shifting viewpoint presently showed the mountains\\r\\nfrom above; the searchlight circle was sweeping across a tumbled land of\\r\\ncrags, plateaus and ravines—a white band of snow lying thick on the\\r\\nhigher peaks. The lens was circling now; the turning, swaying viewpoint\\r\\nmade the watchers dizzy.</p>\\r\\n<p>Finally they saw it—a broken plane lying on its crumbled wing. The\\r\\nsearchlight clung to it; the lens lowered until the image of the plane\\r\\nseemed more than a hundred feet below.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"<i>Toroh\\'s plane!</i>\" Rogers exclaimed.</p>\\r\\n<p>There were figures moving about the plane, men and dogs. The men were\\r\\ndragging some apparatus from it, loading it onto a sled. One of the men\\r\\nwas Toroh! The view<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_139\">[Pg 139]</a></span>point was close enough now to distinguish\\r\\nhim—<i>alive!</i></p>\\r\\n<p>But the flying lens had descended too close; the Noths were staring\\r\\nupward. A flash mounted from below; the crystal mirror turned a blinding\\r\\nwhite—then went black.</p>\\r\\n<p>Toroh\\'s thunderbolt had struck the flying lens and destroyed it.</p>\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 45%;\">\\r\\n<p>George and Dee gazed from their hovering plane at the empty surface of\\r\\nthe level rock face below them. Somewhere in time Azeela was lying\\r\\nthere, unconscious, killed perhaps; the thought messages from her were\\r\\nstilled. Had Toroh gone on? Or had he stopped to try and find her?</p>\\r\\n<p>They were anxious moments for George and Dee—moments that by George\\'s\\r\\nwatch stretched into an hour or more. They were both at the point of\\r\\nexhaustion. They had eaten a little—the plane was provisioned—but they\\r\\nhad not slept throughout the trip. George made a close calculation. He\\r\\nknew the time-speed of Toroh\\'s plane; he could estimate closely what\\r\\nToroh\\'s dials must have read at the instant Azeela jumped.</p>\\r\\n<p>They found her at last, lying on the rock, unconscious. They stopped,\\r\\ncarried her into the plane, and, before they started again, revived her.\\r\\nThere was a heart stimulant among the plane\\'s medicines; she drank it\\r\\ngratefully. She was not injured, though badly bruised by her fall. She\\r\\nhad been knocked unconscious as she left the plane. The instant her body\\r\\nparted contact with its vibrations, blackness had come to her; she did\\r\\nnot remember striking the rock.</p>\\r\\n<p>George was jubilant. Had he been able to rest, he would have wanted to\\r\\ngo on after Toroh. But he did not dare rest.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"We\\'ll go on home,\" he decided. \"You\\'re a brave girl, Azeela.\" He smiled\\r\\ndown at her as she lay stretched out on the leather seat. \"I\\'ll start\\r\\nslowly; you\\'ve had all the shock you can stand.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>That same night in which the flying lens had been destroyed found George\\r\\npiloting his plane into the cavern at<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_140\">[Pg 140]</a></span> Anglese City. Fahn and Rogers\\r\\nwere there to greet them. George handed down the girls, and descended\\r\\nwith a flourish. In the excitement of his triumphant return, he forgot\\r\\nhow tired and sleepy he was.</p>\\r\\n<p>At the moment Loto was in another part of the cavern. He came running\\r\\nforward. He did not see Azeela at first.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"George!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Hello, Loto! Here we are. Were you worried?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Then Loto saw Azeela.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I brought her back to you,\" George said softly. \"There she is, old\\r\\nman—all safe and sound.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>But Loto did not hear him; his arms were around Azeela.</p>\\r\\n<p>George turned to Dee. \"You think he\\'d sacrifice her for the whole nation\\r\\nof the Anglese? I should say not!\"</p>\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 65%;\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h2>\\r\\n<p>A month went by in days and weeks of activity throughout the island. To\\r\\nthe Scientists it was a time of unparalleled stress and anxiety. The\\r\\ngovernment was in their hands for the first time in history, and a\\r\\nwar—the first that anyone of that time-world had ever faced—was\\r\\nimpending.</p>\\r\\n<p>With Toroh\\'s return his attack would not be long postponed. Fahn knew\\r\\nit. The radio proclaimed it to the Bas everywhere. An army must be\\r\\ntrained at once; the Bas, Arans and Scientists were appealed to for\\r\\nvolunteers.</p>\\r\\n<p>It was Fahn\\'s plan not to wait for the Noths to land on the island; but\\r\\nto anticipate the attack and send an army to meet it. The nation\\r\\nresponded to the appeal. Conscription had been considered, but within a\\r\\nday the Bas had offered themselves in such numbers that it was obvious\\r\\nany form of conscription would be unnecessary.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_141\">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>The second day after the radio appeal for volunteers, the fact became\\r\\nevident that the Arans were refusing to go to war. In every village\\r\\nrecruiting stations were listing the names of the young men of the Bas\\r\\nwho presented themselves, but no Arans came. By the audible broadcasting\\r\\nFahn called them severely to account; but still they remained in hiding.\\r\\nThey were sought out. Cowardice, sullenness, declaration that their\\r\\nbirthright made it unnecessary—they seemed to have a score of reasons,\\r\\nbut the fact remained they would not willingly serve.</p>\\r\\n<p>Scenes of violence were reported the next day. A Bas father, giving two\\r\\nsons to the coming war, had struck down an Aran youth whom he\\r\\nencountered; a party of Bas, angered into unlawfulness, had entered an\\r\\nAran household in Orleen and beaten a group of Arans who were holding\\r\\nfestivities; an Aran woman had been killed.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Serves them right,\" George exclaimed indignantly. \"I\\'d kill them all.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Fahn was perturbed, but then he shrugged. \"We have far more young men\\r\\nfrom the Bas than we can use. I shall tell them to ignore the Arans. And\\r\\nin warfare such as this, an unwilling fighter is worse than none.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Damned cowards,\" George muttered. \"We\\'ll save their hides for \\'em,\\r\\nwhile they stay home and have parties.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The Scientist had caught the words. \"Yes, George, because now that is\\r\\neasiest for us. I want no trouble here on the island. But\\r\\nafterward—when we have won—<i>then</i> we can deal with the Arans.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I wouldn\\'t have \\'em on the island,\" George declared. It would have been\\r\\nan unfortunate Aran youth who encountered George during the days that\\r\\nfollowed.</p>\\r\\n<p>The recruiting, hand in hand with the manufacturing activities of the\\r\\ncavern, went steadily on. In every principal village the Bas youths were\\r\\nregistered and drilled, as yet without weapons. Officered by older men\\r\\nof the Bas, they waited for the equipment and orders to come to them\\r\\nfrom Anglese City.</p>\\r\\n<p>The information Fahn had regarding Toroh and his Noth<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_142\">[Pg 142]</a></span> army was vague,\\r\\nunsatisfactory; its very meagerness seemed to forecast disaster.\\r\\nSomewhere beyond the mountains the Noths were gathering along the\\r\\nAtlantic Coast. Hordes of men and fighting dogs were coming southward.\\r\\nBut their scientific weapons were practically unknown. The thunderbolt\\r\\nglobes—of what power Fahn could not say—were all that he was positive\\r\\nthey possessed.</p>\\r\\n<p>It was Toroh\\'s trip back into time that seemed to hold the greatest\\r\\nmenace. He had secured some apparatus. What was it? Something\\r\\ninvincible, perhaps; something so completely different from anything\\r\\nwith which the Anglese were familiar that they could not hope to cope\\r\\nwith it.</p>\\r\\n<p>There were no answers to these questions.</p>\\r\\n<p>The flying lens—the only one the Anglese possessed—had been destroyed.\\r\\nOthers were now being hastily constructed, and with them Fahn intended\\r\\nto reconnoiter extensively over the Noth territory. The information thus\\r\\nattained would be immensely valuable.</p>\\r\\n<p>The principle of this radio-controlled flying platform, as Fahn had\\r\\nsaid, was newly invented. It was not yet wholly practical. The dais at\\r\\nthe Festival was the first crude model; the flying lens was the second.\\r\\nIt had been so successful a model for a beginning that Fahn was\\r\\nencouraged to use it with a broader scope. Larger platforms were now\\r\\nbeing built, and thunderbolt projectors were to be mounted on\\r\\nthem—projectors with an effective radius of a thousand feet. A number\\r\\nof these flying platforms would constitute a mechanical army. Controlled\\r\\nby radios whose operators stayed safely at home, it could be sent forth\\r\\nto battle—with the human army to follow behind it.</p>\\r\\n<p>The perfecting of the electric fabric repulsive to the earth—an\\r\\ninvention revived out of the past and brought to practicability only\\r\\nwithin the last few months—was the basis of the equipment for the\\r\\nAnglese army now being mobilized. It was kept secret until the last\\r\\nmoment.</p>\\r\\n<p>Two weeks after George\\'s return, the first flying organization was\\r\\nequipped. Two hundred young men selected from the ranks of the\\r\\nScientists began drilling secretly at<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_143\">[Pg 143]</a></span> night in an open space near\\r\\nAnglese City. Among them were George and Loto. For the men from our\\r\\ntime-world, the experience was the most extraordinary they had ever\\r\\nundergone. The fabric was like thin black gauze. A loose suit of it\\r\\nencased each man, bound tightly at his wrists, throat and ankles. About\\r\\nhis waist was strapped a broad, cloth belt with several pockets in which\\r\\nto carry various weapons. There was some sort of a battery attached to\\r\\nthe belt, from which a current was turned into the gauze suit.</p>\\r\\n<p>One of Fahns assistants came over to George and adjusted the current to\\r\\nhis normal weight, while George stood eyeing the man fearsomely. He\\r\\ncould feel the current as it was turned on. It was not unpleasant; it\\r\\nmade him tingle all over.</p>\\r\\n<p>In another moment George was ready. Thin cloth slippers were on his\\r\\nfeet; by the pressure against the soles he felt as though he weighed not\\r\\nmore than five pounds. Involuntarily, he clutched at Loto, who stood\\r\\nbeside him. He felt that a breath of wind would blow him away.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Let go,\" Loto grinned. \"Make a leap, George.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Obediently George leaped gingerly into the air. He floated upward,\\r\\nturned over, arms and legs flying, and floated downward, landing gently\\r\\non his face in the sand. But after a few trials he could hold his\\r\\nbalance; the air seemed fluid, like water. With wings fastened to his\\r\\narms and legs, he could have swum through it.</p>\\r\\n<p>He suggested that to Loto. \"Why, with practice, a man could swim through\\r\\nthe air, darting about like a fish through water.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Loto laughed. \"You\\'d make a fine inventor, George. That probably was the\\r\\nfirst crude way it was used. But later they developed a much better way\\r\\nof propulsion, and we have revived it now.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The motive power consisted of a single metal cylinder to be held in the\\r\\nleft hand—an apparatus which in weight and shape was not unlike an\\r\\nordinary flashlight. As George understood its fundamental principle, the\\r\\nthing altered the density of the air in whatever direction it was\\r\\npointed.</p>\\r\\n<p>Loto tried to explain it with as few technical words as<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_144\">[Pg 144]</a></span> he could. A\\r\\nspreading, invisible ray from the cylinder penetrated the air for a\\r\\ndistance of some ten feet. It separated the molecules of the air, drove\\r\\nthem apart. Its action was incredibly swift.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Well?\" demanded George.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"The atmosphere exerts a pressure here of some sixteen pounds to the\\r\\nsquare inch,\" Loto said. \"The air immediately in advance of this\\r\\ncylinder mouth is almost instantly thinned out. The ray charges the\\r\\nmolecules of air and makes them slightly repellent. The result is,\\r\\nGeorge, that immediately in advance of your body the atmospheric\\r\\npressure is somewhat lessened. Thus, your body moves forward, pushed by\\r\\nthe air pressure from behind.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The cylinder had a sliding lever by which its ray was turned on or off.\\r\\nGeorge held it over his head and moved the lever. His body left the\\r\\nground and shot straight up at increasing speed. There was no rush of\\r\\nwind toward him; instead the air from below seemed to be wafting him\\r\\nupward.</p>\\r\\n<p>The ground was dropping away. Fifty feet! A hundred feet! Panic struck\\r\\nGeorge; all he could think of to do was shut off the cylinder power. At\\r\\nonce he floated down, turning over helplessly. He landed quite gently,\\r\\nseveral hundred feet from where he had started, with Loto running there\\r\\nto meet him, laughing at his discomfiture.</p>\\r\\n<p>You couldn\\'t very well get hurt, that was the beauty of the thing.\\r\\nGeorge plunged enthusiastically into learning how to handle himself in\\r\\nthe air.</p>\\r\\n<p>With a week this organization of two hundred Scientist young men were\\r\\nfairly expert with the new flying apparatus. There were several thousand\\r\\nBas youths now registered in different parts of the island; but the\\r\\nsuits and air cylinders for them were not ready. Finally, another\\r\\nhundred were released, and at Anglese City, Mogruud, the Bas leader, and\\r\\na hundred selected Bas young men began learning to use them.</p>\\r\\n<p>In spite of the indignant protests of Loto and George,<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_145\">[Pg 145]</a></span> both Fahn\\'s\\r\\ndaughters urged that they be allowed to try the apparatus, and Fahn gave\\r\\nhis permission.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I have no sons to give,\" he said quietly. \"And this warfare is of\\r\\nskill, not strength or endurance. If my girls can help their country, it\\r\\nis their duty—and mine—to make the sacrifice.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>With this precedent, other Scientist girls—several at Orleen, and\\r\\ntwenty at Anglese City—enthusiastically volunteered. Without exception,\\r\\nthe girls proved superior to the men. The new art demanded a deft\\r\\nagility, a quickness of thought and movement, which seemed to come to\\r\\nthe girls more naturally.</p>\\r\\n<p>Within a few days, Azeela and Dee could dart through the air with\\r\\nincredible dexterity. The cylinder held in the left hand could be\\r\\npointed quickly in any direction and the body would be drawn that way.\\r\\nDee, especially, became proficient. She could dart upward, turn, come\\r\\nswooping down head-first or with slow somersaults, graceful as a dancer,\\r\\nto right herself a few feet above the ground and land on tiptoe.</p>\\r\\n<p>The result of the girls\\' proficiency was that they were organized into a\\r\\nseparate squad. There were twenty-eight girls in all; thirteen commanded\\r\\nby Azeela, and thirteen by Dee.</p>\\r\\n<p>During all this time, the Arans had remained in seclusion, keeping off\\r\\nthe streets as much as possible. The Bas, drilling without weapons, were\\r\\neager to be equipped. The king and his council confined themselves to\\r\\nthe palace at Anglese City.</p>\\r\\n<p>There were no boats on the island except crude sailing canoes. A few of\\r\\nthe newly equipped flying corps went northward; but Fahn, anticipating\\r\\nthe completion of other flying lenses, ordered them not to cross the\\r\\nchannel. In the cavern, day and night, operators watched the mirrors,\\r\\nflashing the viewpoints from every coast tower on the island, to guard\\r\\nagainst a surprise attack.</p>\\r\\n<p>A month had passed since George\\'s return in the plane. He had suggested\\r\\nseveral times that the plane might be used<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_146\">[Pg 146]</a></span> in the war. But Rogers\\r\\nrefused this. George had exhausted the proton current to the point where\\r\\nthere was barely enough left for a return to Roger\\'s time-world. And the\\r\\nplane in itself, as a means of flying through space, would have been of\\r\\nlittle value in this warfare.</p>\\r\\n<p>The flying discs, mounted with observing lenses and thunderbolt\\r\\nprojectors, were now ready. They were sent out one night, controlled\\r\\nfrom the cavern.</p>\\r\\n<p>It was the first aggressive act of the war; a mechanical army sweeping\\r\\nnorthward to attack the enemy.</p>\\r\\n<p>In the cavern room, Fahn and his friends sat watching the mirrors, which\\r\\nshowed the scene from the viewpoint of the flying mechanisms.</p>\\r\\n<p>The discs swept northward, following the coastline. Beyond the\\r\\nmountains, far ahead, loomed a great encampment close to the shore, dim\\r\\nand vague in the moonlight. In a few minutes the mechanisms would be\\r\\nthere.</p>\\r\\n<p>Suddenly, one of the mirrors in operation went black. In the others, the\\r\\nscene showed that Toroh was sending up some opposing mechanisms. Dots of\\r\\nsilver were mounting from the encampment. They floated slowly upward,\\r\\nbut they seemed to seek out the Anglese flying platforms, pursuing them\\r\\nas though with human intelligence.</p>\\r\\n<p>One by one the mirrors were going black, as the flying lenses were being\\r\\ndestroyed. In a moment only one was left. It was almost over Toroh\\'s\\r\\nencampment—almost in range where it could have discharged its bolt.</p>\\r\\n<p>In the mirrored scene, a white dot was growing as it came closer to the\\r\\nlens. Its image grew; it resolved itself from a dot, so what Fahn saw\\r\\nwas a thin, gleaming disc. It looked as though it might be whirling. The\\r\\nthing turned, pursued the lens, overtook it—the last mirror went dark.</p>\\r\\n<p>The operators, greatly upset, left their instruments and gathered around\\r\\nFahn. Toroh had sent up some unknown mechanisms; the flying thunderbolt\\r\\nplatforms had crashed to the ground before any of them had come within\\r\\nrange of the enemy.</p>\\r\\n<p>It was during this same night that Toroh first used his<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_147\">[Pg 147]</a></span> audible\\r\\nbroadcasting beams. Fahn\\'s audible voices in the air had constantly been\\r\\nencouraging his people. Now, abruptly, the air burst forth with other\\r\\nvoices. Somewhere in the mountains across the channel, Toroh had erected\\r\\na broadcasting station. He was sending threats through the air to the\\r\\nAnglese!</p>\\r\\n<p>It was a surprise, and it disturbed Fahn greatly. Everywhere on the\\r\\nisland aerial voices of the enemy were leering, threatening, boasting of\\r\\nthe coming triumph of the Noths. Would the Bas be intimidated? It might\\r\\nbe disastrous; with the defeat of the flying discs, Fahn was depending\\r\\nmore than ever now upon the Bas army.</p>\\r\\n<p>All that night and next day, the sender from the cavern sent forth its\\r\\ncheering messages.</p>\\r\\n<p>By the following noon information began coming to Anglese City that the\\r\\nBas were apparently not alarmed. They were jeering back at Toroh\\'s\\r\\naerial voices; but they were demanding vigorously that the Scientists\\r\\ngive them weapons.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"In a week we shall be ready,\" Fahn told Rogers. \"Five thousand\\r\\nair-pressure cylinders are now in the last process of manufacture. The\\r\\nother weapons are ready. One week more is all we need.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Amid Toroh\\'s aerial threats that day had come the reiterated, triumphant\\r\\nstatement that in two weeks more his attack would come. Two weeks still!\\r\\nIt was more than Fahn had hoped for.</p>\\r\\n<p>The statement was Toroh\\'s trickery. Eighteen hours later—the next\\r\\nmorning at dawn—a member of the aerial patrol over the channel returned\\r\\nhurriedly to Anglese City with the news that Toroh\\'s expedition had\\r\\nstarted by water. Huge barges were coming down the coast, pulled by the\\r\\ngiant dogs swimming before them—<i>barges crowded with men and dogs and\\r\\napparatus</i>.</p>\\r\\n<p>That morning was one of almost complete chaos. The invaders would enter\\r\\nthe channel near Anglese City. The thunderbolt projectors which had been\\r\\ndistributed thinly about the coast were rushed eastward and\\r\\nconcentrated<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_148\">[Pg 148]</a></span> at the channel-mouth. There was no time now to equip the\\r\\nmain Bas army. The attack would have to be repelled by the coast\\r\\ndefense, and by the small aerial army already formed: one hundred Bas\\r\\nled by Mogruud; two hundred Scientists with whom Loto and George were to\\r\\nserve, and the twenty-six Scientist girls, led by Azeela and Dee.</p>\\r\\n<p>That morning the aerial voices ordered every able-bodied Bas man on the\\r\\nisland to come toward Anglese City with every dog that could be\\r\\nprocured. If the invaders landed, the dogs could best oppose them.</p>\\r\\n<p>It was at this juncture that the king announced the change of his royal\\r\\ncapital to Orleen. The royal family, the councilors, their\\r\\nretainers—all fled in their dog carriages from Anglese City. Orleen,\\r\\nmuch further down the channel, would be safe. News of the king\\'s action\\r\\nspread over the island. Arans from everywhere fled after him, huddling\\r\\nin Orleen.</p>\\r\\n<p>In the confusion of those hours, the contempt for the Arans passed\\r\\nalmost without comment. Orleen was the safest place, and the Bas\\r\\nthere—men and women both—scornful of remaining among the cowards, came\\r\\neastward.</p>\\r\\n<p>By noon the flying army was fully accoutered and waiting in a field near\\r\\nAnglese City. Loto, equipped to remain in constant telephonic\\r\\ncommunication with Fahn, was virtually the leader. George, with his\\r\\nseveral weapons in his belt, stood beside Loto. Mogruud had his hundred\\r\\nBas around him. The girls were in two small groups apart.</p>\\r\\n<p>At a signal from Fahn, the little army rose swiftly into the sunlit sky.\\r\\nThe watching throng was stricken silent with awe. The figures in the air\\r\\narranged themselves in a broad arc, with the officers in front, and then\\r\\nswept forward, over the channel toward the mountains and the distant\\r\\nsea.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_149\">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 65%;\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h2>\\r\\n<p>The palm-dotted island fell silently away. Ahead lay the blue channel;\\r\\nto the right the open sea. To George the flight—the first of any\\r\\nduration he had taken—was exhilarating. It was soundless; the absence\\r\\nof any rush of air against him made it totally unlike flying in a plane.\\r\\nHe seemed to be wafting forward as though the air were his native\\r\\nelement.</p>\\r\\n<p>Loto was just ahead of him. Behind him came the army, maintaining its\\r\\narc-like formation. A little in front, and at a slightly lower level,\\r\\nwere the two squads of girls. They were all slim, graceful creatures,\\r\\nmost of them under twenty. The black gauze—loose trousers and\\r\\nblouse—showed the white of their limbs beneath. Their heads were bound\\r\\nin deep-red rubber cloth, tight over the forehead and tied in back with\\r\\nflowing ends. With cylinders extended from the left hand they slid\\r\\ngracefully forward through the air.</p>\\r\\n<p>Though George felt no rush of air, he found he could not talk to Loto,\\r\\neven though no more than twenty feet separated them. The rushing wind\\r\\nbetween them tore away the words.</p>\\r\\n<p>Soon they were over the channel. The girls were drifting much lower now.\\r\\nLoto darted down a few feet; then as though he had changed his mind, he\\r\\ncame up again. He reached for a mouthpiece that dangled under his chin\\r\\nand fitted it to his lips. His voice, magnified to a stentorian roar,\\r\\nrolled out.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"<i>Azeela! Dee! Come higher! You must not go so low!</i>\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Obediently the two girls rose to the higher level, their<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_150\">[Pg 150]</a></span> little squads\\r\\nfollowing them. When they were over the mouth of the channel, George saw\\r\\nToroh\\'s barges—tiny dark smudges on the water some miles up the coast\\r\\nand a mile or so off shore. His heart leaped, began pounding in spite of\\r\\nhis efforts to quiet it.</p>\\r\\n<p>Following Loto he swept diagonally upward and forward. Presently he\\r\\ncould count six barges. They were tremendous things, crowded with men\\r\\nand dogs and mechanical apparatus. Spread over each was a huge caging of\\r\\nflashing silver metal. One barge was some distance in the lead; the\\r\\nothers straggled out irregularly behind it for about a mile. All the\\r\\nNoth vessels were being drawn slowly through the water by ranks of\\r\\nharnessed dogs.</p>\\r\\n<p>Loto momentarily shut off his cylinder; his speed was slackening. George\\r\\novertook him, put an arm on his shoulder. The nearest of the barges was\\r\\nnow less than a mile ahead.</p>\\r\\n<p>An upward flash from the leading barge was followed in a few seconds by\\r\\na crack of thunder. The bolt dissipated harmlessly into the air. But\\r\\nobviously it was powerful, with an effective range of two thousand\\r\\nfeet—twice that of the Anglese defense.</p>\\r\\n<p>Toroh\\'s plan now became apparent. He would batter the Anglese coast\\r\\nprojectors while still beyond reach of them, and then make his landing.\\r\\nThe cages over the barges were for protection from the smaller\\r\\nthunderbolts of the attacking aerial army.</p>\\r\\n<p>George knew the cages were only partially effective. A bolt was\\r\\ndifficult to aim, but it did queer things when it struck. From a short\\r\\ndistance—a hundred feet or less—the barges could be set on fire and\\r\\nsunk. Their thin metal hulls were not protected. They could be pierced.\\r\\nThe wooden super-structure could be fired; the swimming dogs struck and\\r\\nkilled.</p>\\r\\n<p>In hurried whispers Loto was constantly talking with Fahn back in the\\r\\ncavern. The Scientist\\'s orders he repeated with his electrically\\r\\nmagnified voice that could be heard easily by every one of the little\\r\\naerial army.</p>\\r\\n<p>For a time they circled about, above the barges, but<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_151\">[Pg 151]</a></span> keeping well\\r\\nbeyond the two-thousand foot range. Against the blue of the sky their\\r\\nfigures must have shown plainly to the Noths. Occasionally a bolt would\\r\\nflash up, but they were harmless at that distance. And the barges pushed\\r\\nsteadily forward.</p>\\r\\n<p>At last Fahn decided the moment for attack had arrived. Loto repeated\\r\\nthe order. George\\'s division and Mogruud\\'s separated from the rest. One\\r\\nhundred turned seaward, the others toward land. They dropped swiftly;\\r\\nstraight down, like divers, heavily laden with lead, dropping through\\r\\nwater. And then a darting, twisting swarm of insects—from every side at\\r\\nonce they attacked the leading barge.</p>\\r\\n<p>In the depths of the cavern at Anglese City, Fahn sat in his room of\\r\\nmirrors. A metal band about his head held a receiver to his ear. A black\\r\\nmouthpiece hung against his chest and by lowering his head he could\\r\\nbring his lips to it. Rogers was at his side. The mirrors in every part\\r\\nof the room were lighted, giving the viewpoints of the coast towers near\\r\\nthe mouth of the channel. In several of the mirrored scenes, over the\\r\\ndistant water and in the air, black specks were visible; the enemy and\\r\\nFahn\\'s army above them.</p>\\r\\n<p>But these were not the vital crystal mirrors. A small one—a foot square\\r\\nperhaps—stood on the table before Fahn. He and Rogers were gazing into\\r\\nit intently. The mirror was connected with a tiny lens strapped to\\r\\nLoto\\'s forehead; it gave Loto\\'s viewpoint of the battle, showed the\\r\\nscene exactly as Loto saw it.</p>\\r\\n<p>Fahn was silent; a stern, anxious old man, with all his science around\\r\\nhim, sitting in seclusion to direct this warfare upon which the fate of\\r\\nhis people depended. Occasionally he would murmur something to Rogers,\\r\\nand the other man would speak into a mouthpiece—an order for the\\r\\noperator of the broadcasted aerial voices, controlled from another part\\r\\nof the cavern. Then throughout the island, cheering words to the Bas\\r\\nwould resound, news of the progress of the battle. But Fahn\\'s gaze never\\r\\nwavered from the little mirror.</p>\\r\\n<p>George\\'s and Mogruud\\'s divisions descended upon the<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_152\">[Pg 152]</a></span> leading barge. The\\r\\nbarge spat forth its bolts, but it could discharge only one or two\\r\\nagainst a hundred of the tiny ones from its attackers. Looking down,\\r\\nfrom Loto\\'s viewpoint overhead, the barge was assailed on every side by\\r\\nthe pencils of electrical flame. Figures dropped, inert, into the water;\\r\\nothers, wounded, wavered upward. The wire cage over the barge was\\r\\nsizzling and crackling; the swimming dogs, a dozen or more of them,\\r\\ncrumpled in the water and were dragged forward in their harness by the\\r\\nothers.</p>\\r\\n<p>The engagement had lasted no more than a minute when the air about the\\r\\nbarge was suddenly plunged into blackness. Everything down there was\\r\\nblotted out—a patch of solid ink on the sea. The Noth vessel had\\r\\nexploded a bomb whose etheric vibration absorbed all light over a radius\\r\\nof five hundred feet.</p>\\r\\n<p>Fahn smiled grimly. The darkness there would pass presently. His own\\r\\nleaders, Loto, George, Mogruud and the two girls, had the same\\r\\nequipment. Each of them could discharge such a bomb; a puff of darkness,\\r\\ncloaking everything around them in temporary invisibility.</p>\\r\\n<p>Fahn heard his own orders roared by Loto. The attacking figures came up.\\r\\nBut there were not two hundred of them now: about twenty lay down there\\r\\nin the water; a dozen more were wounded; a few were moving slowly\\r\\nhomeward through the air.</p>\\r\\n<p>The darkness still hung around the attacked Noth vessel. But it was\\r\\nthinning out; now the vague outlines of the barge could be seen. Within\\r\\na minute the dark patch was gone. One end of the barge was blazing, but\\r\\nthe Noths were extinguishing the flames. Other figures were cutting\\r\\nloose the dead dogs in the water, while new dogs were leaping overboard\\r\\nto take their places.</p>\\r\\n<p>The attacked barge presently moved onward; slowly, inexorably, they were\\r\\nall coming down the coast. They were no more than a mile or two now from\\r\\nthe estuary of the channel-mouth.</p>\\r\\n<p>Three times more Fahn ordered a division down at the same barge. The\\r\\nNoth tactics were repeated. The barge dis<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_153\">[Pg 153]</a></span>charged a few of its bolts and\\r\\nthen enveloped itself in blackness—an absence of light that even the\\r\\nthunderbolts could not illumine.</p>\\r\\n<p>These brief engagements were largely a matter of individual action.\\r\\nWarfare was new to the Anglese, but they were learning. The huge bolts\\r\\nfrom the barge could not parallel the water level for long; inevitably\\r\\nthey turned downward to discharge themselves. Close to the water the\\r\\nattackers were comparatively safe.</p>\\r\\n<p>When the Anglese came up after these attacks and reformed themselves in\\r\\norderly array, there were only ten more of their number missing. But it\\r\\nwas fifty in all, and a score of wounded.</p>\\r\\n<p>The attacked barge was blazing end to end. Its crowded deck was a\\r\\nturmoil of figures. They were plunging overboard—men and dogs—to avoid\\r\\nthe flames. In a moment the barge tilted upward at its stern. Its torn\\r\\nbow was admitting the water; it slid downward, hissing, and disappeared\\r\\nbeneath the surface. Figures bobbed up from the swirl, inert, charred\\r\\nfigures; others among them, still alive, swam about in aimless\\r\\nconfusion.</p>\\r\\n<p>One barge! But there were five more. And these others had all pushed\\r\\nforward until now they were almost down to the channel. Fahn realized\\r\\nthat there were five hundred Noths and as many dogs crowded into each of\\r\\nthem. They could take to the water while they were still beyond range of\\r\\nhis coast projectors and come forward individually, each man mounted\\r\\nupon his swimming dog. The coast defense could strike down no more than\\r\\na few of them if they came in that fashion. Twenty-five hundred men and\\r\\ntheir giant brutes, landing on the island.</p>\\r\\n<p>Azeela and Dee were hovering close to Loto; they were asking their\\r\\nfather\\'s permission to try a new plan. The battle could not be\\r\\nmaintained as it was going; the hand thunderbolt globes held but ten\\r\\ncharges each, and the equipment of each individual was only three\\r\\nglobes. A third of the thunderbolts were already exhausted in sinking\\r\\none barge.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_154\">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>Fahn\\'s expression did not change; only the grip of his fingers as he\\r\\nclenched them and the rising muscles under his thin cheeks betokened his\\r\\nemotion. His voice was steady, grim as always, when he ordered his\\r\\ndaughters to their desperate venture.</p>\\r\\n<p>Azeela and Dee, with their twenty-six comrades, selected the barge that\\r\\nhad replaced the leader. In a closely knit group they hovered above it.\\r\\nThunderbolts shot up, but could not reach them. The girls aimed a\\r\\npure-white beam of light downward—twenty-six tiny rays blending into\\r\\none. Rogers, bending over Fahn to gaze into the little mirror, was\\r\\namazed. Unlike any beam of light he had ever seen, this one was curved;\\r\\nIt descended in a slightly bent bow, ending at the barge.</p>\\r\\n<p>Fahn whispered a swift explanation to Rogers. To the Noths, looking\\r\\nupward along the beam, it would not appear curved, but straight. The\\r\\nfigures of the girls, by an optical illusion, would be seen, not where\\r\\nthey actually were, but to one side.</p>\\r\\n<p>The girls held their curved ray steady. And plunging down the beam,\\r\\nfollowing its slightly curved path, were the figures of Azeela and Dee.</p>\\r\\n<p>The Noths saw them coming; a dozen bolts leaped into the air, one upon\\r\\nthe other, but they flashed harmlessly to one side of their mark.</p>\\r\\n<p>Within twenty seconds the two girls were close to the barge; yellow-red\\r\\nspurts of flame leaped from their weapons—flame that could be hurled\\r\\nthirty feet but no farther. It enveloped the barge with licking,\\r\\nseething, burning liquid gases that withered everything they touched. A\\r\\npuff of darkness, which the retreating girls had left behind them,\\r\\nblotted out the scene. An instant later Azeela and Dee emerged from the\\r\\ndarkness, safe. The shaft of light from the girls above was extinguished\\r\\nas the two rose to join them.</p>\\r\\n<p>When light shone again around the barge, it was sinking. Soon the\\r\\nswirling water held nothing but black, twisted figures.</p>\\r\\n<p>The maneuver could not be repeated successfully. From<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_155\">[Pg 155]</a></span> the other barges\\r\\nthe Noths would have seen the curved beam, understood it and made\\r\\nallowances for it. Azeela and Dee, triumphant and flushed with their\\r\\nsuccess, pleaded to try it again, but Fahn would not let them.</p>\\r\\n<p>The afternoon was waning; the western sky was red and overhead clouds\\r\\nwere gathering. And then Fahn ordered a general attack on all the\\r\\nbarges.</p>\\r\\n<p>The sun had set; the twilight deepened into night—a night of flashing\\r\\nlights, crackling, artificial thunder, spurts of lurid flame and the\\r\\nhissing of fire against water. At intervals, rockets came up; bursting,\\r\\nthey cast a blue-white glare that for the space of a minute clearly\\r\\noutlined the menacing, darting figures for the Noths.</p>\\r\\n<p>The atmospheric disturbance of the past hours suddenly brought forth an\\r\\nelectrical storm. Nature, more powerful than man, shot forth her own\\r\\nbolts to add to the din. They were, in character, very different from\\r\\nthe harnessed, man-made lightning; forked, jagged, crackling with their\\r\\nnearness, they leaped downward out of the low-hanging clouds.</p>\\r\\n<p>The storm was as brief as it was severe. It swept away and the moon\\r\\nrose, blood-red, casting its lurid light over the water.</p>\\r\\n<p>Another Noth vessel had been sunk. There were only three barges left\\r\\nafloat, and they were in distress. Many of their swimming dogs lay dead\\r\\nin harness. Aboard all three of them, figures were fighting the flames.\\r\\nThey clustered in a group near the center of the channel.</p>\\r\\n<p>Loto had withdrawn his forces, reduced now to half their original\\r\\nnumber. With ammunition almost exhausted, they hovered out of range\\r\\nabove their adversaries. The wounded were still straggling back through\\r\\nthe air; a few of them had already arrived at the cavern.</p>\\r\\n<p>Again Fahn ordered his army down. It would be the last attempt.</p>\\r\\n<p>In the cavern room, Fahn had not moved from his seat for hours. Often he\\r\\ncould not see the battle plainly, for Loto, disobeying orders, had many\\r\\ntimes cast himself into the thick of it.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_156\">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>But now Loto was aloft; by the moonlight and the glare of the rockets\\r\\nand bombs, Fahn saw that another Noth vessel had appeared—a very small\\r\\nbarge. It was close to shore, coming swiftly forward and little objects\\r\\nof gleaming silver were mounting from it. One after the other they came\\r\\nsailing up.</p>\\r\\n<p>Fahn rasped an order; Loto\\'s voice roared it out. The men and girls who\\r\\nwere descending to the attack halted, circling about, wondering what had\\r\\nhappened.</p>\\r\\n<p>The first of the white objects came sailing slowly horizontally across\\r\\nthe channel. It seemed to be a whirling white disc some foot or two in\\r\\ndiameter.</p>\\r\\n<p>Loto was still some distance away from it when a group of girls passed\\r\\nbetween him and the disc. The thing seemed to turn toward them. One of\\r\\nthe girls became confused; it struck her and she fell. The disc, its\\r\\nrotation halted, fell also. Loto saw then what it was: broad, thin,\\r\\ncrossed blades of steel, inclined to each other like the blades of a\\r\\npropeller. It had risen up and sustained itself in the air by rotation.\\r\\nLoto remembered the defeat of the flying thunderbolt platforms which\\r\\nFahn had sent northward to Toroh\\'s encampment. These whirling knives\\r\\nwere what had destroyed them!</p>\\r\\n<p>The newly arrived barge was now sending up, in every direction, a slow\\r\\nbut steady stream of the whirling knives. They seemed so easy to avoid\\r\\nthat the aerial army at first paid them little heed. Loto\\'s warning from\\r\\nFahn rang out, but it came almost too late. The knives sought out the\\r\\nfigures in the air. They began falling—cut, mangled by the whirling\\r\\nblades. There was confusion. The army mounted higher, but other knives\\r\\nhad been sent straight upward and were floating down. Uncannily, they\\r\\nseemed to single out their victims.</p>\\r\\n<p>Fahn understood now. This was the weapon Toroh had procured from that\\r\\ntime-world of the past. These whirling knives were strangely, powerfully\\r\\nmagnetized; they followed the human bodies passing near them, seeking\\r\\ncontact.</p>\\r\\n<p>The Scientist leader had ordered his fighters to the sea level; the\\r\\nknives, as they came lower, seemed to have spent<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_157\">[Pg 157]</a></span> themselves. They could\\r\\nbe avoided. But nearly forty of the Anglese had met death before the\\r\\nlesson was learned.</p>\\r\\n<p>The three larger barges were again advancing toward the Anglese coast.\\r\\nWithout warning, without orders from Fahn, the little remnant of girls\\r\\nled by Azeela and Dee, darted at them. It was a movement, not foolhardy,\\r\\nbut well and swiftly planned. The girls, holding close to the surface,\\r\\ngot themselves between two of the barges. The Noths could not fire, for\\r\\nthey would have struck each other. A puff of inky darkness spread over\\r\\nthe ships, and out of it, at close range, jets of fire sprang at the\\r\\nNoths; then the girls came back. One of the Noth vessels was a mass of\\r\\nflames; the other two wavered—and began retreating.</p>\\r\\n<p>For a moment there was silence and darkness, lighted only by the moon\\r\\nand the flickering light from the blazing barge. The whirling blades\\r\\nwere no longer being launched; the Anglese were again poised in the air.</p>\\r\\n<p>Fahn had ordered that the small barge be attacked when, abruptly, a low\\r\\nhum sounded from it. George and Loto were hovering together at the\\r\\nmoment; the barge was some five hundred feet below them and slightly off\\r\\nto one side. There didn\\'t seem to be any dogs on it; only a few men\\r\\nunder its wire cage, and a single large piece of apparatus.</p>\\r\\n<p>The hum grew louder, more intense, as though some gigantic dynamo had\\r\\nbeen set into motion.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"What\\'s that?\" George demanded.</p>\\r\\n<p>But Loto did not know.</p>\\r\\n<p>Mogruud, with the remains of his division, was in the air half a mile\\r\\naway. He was on the other side of the small barge; his men, moving in\\r\\nscattered groups, began passing over it.</p>\\r\\n<p>The hum was rising in pitch, up the scale until it became a shrill\\r\\nelectrical scream. Mogruud\\'s men wavered—struggled as though to avoid\\r\\nbeing pulled downward.</p>\\r\\n<p>Then Loto realized that it must be the rest of the apparatus Toroh had\\r\\nsecured out of the past—a giant electromagnet of some unknown variety.\\r\\nIt was pulling at every figure in the air, drawing them irresistibly\\r\\ntoward it.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_158\">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>Loto and George could feel the pull; invisible fingers were snatching at\\r\\nthem. The girls near at hand were fighting against it. Mogruud was\\r\\nmoving forward with an effort, like a swimmer struggling with the clutch\\r\\nof an undertow. Several of his men, closer to the barge, had been drawn\\r\\nto it, flattened helplessly against its wire caging. Fire was leaping\\r\\nthrough their bodies...they were electrocuted.</p>\\r\\n<p>In the cavern Fahn sat tense, impotent. He could hear, as plainly as\\r\\nthough he were out there over the sea, the scream of that uncanny thing\\r\\nthat was reaching out its invisible electrical fingers to gather in its\\r\\nvictims.</p>\\r\\n<p>At his side, for the past hour, Rogers had been operating the larger\\r\\nmirrors, flashing into them scenes from the various towers along the\\r\\ncoast. Now Fahn heard him give a sharp, horrified exclamation.</p>\\r\\n<p>Rogers was staring at a mirrored scene from a coast tower near Orleen:\\r\\nmoonlight, purple, starry sky and the deep purple of the channel; to one\\r\\nside, the dim outlines of the Orleen houses. And from the channel off\\r\\nOrleen, lights were flashing; a bomb burst and its glare shone on\\r\\ncrowded barges close inshore! One of them, already at the beach, was\\r\\ndisgorging its men and brutes!</p>\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 65%;\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h2>\\r\\n<p>Once again, Toroh\\'s trickery was disclosed. To Fahn, the tactics of the\\r\\nNoths were now understandable. The Noth attack on Anglese City, at which\\r\\nFahn had hurled all his armed forces, had been no more than a ruse to\\r\\ncover up Toroh\\'s main offensive at Orleen.</p>\\r\\n<p>Toroh\\'s orders, doubtless, had been to prolong the en<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_159\">[Pg 159]</a></span>gagement until,\\r\\nunder cover of night, his main forces could effect their landing at the\\r\\nother end of the island. This small barge with the magnet had probably\\r\\nbeen ordered to slip by, hugging the north shore of the channel, and\\r\\nproceed to Orleen. But its commander had, at what he must have\\r\\nconsidered a decisive moment, used it against the remnant of the little\\r\\naerial army.</p>\\r\\n<p>Toroh\\'s landing at Orleen was taking place; the channel expedition had\\r\\nserved its purpose. The two remaining barges off Anglese City were in\\r\\nfull retreat toward the open sea. The smaller barge, with its screaming\\r\\nmagnet, was heading swiftly down the channel toward Orleen. The figures\\r\\nin the air were struggling against its pull. Some were losing, being\\r\\nhurled forward with control of themselves lost; others were forcing\\r\\ntheir way down to the water-level where the attraction seemed less.\\r\\nStill others had succeeded in escaping upward beyond its range. They\\r\\ncircled high overhead, seeking some way of helping their unfortunate\\r\\ncomrades.</p>\\r\\n<p>The double disaster was more than Fahn could cope with, or even watch\\r\\nclosely in the two mirrors. Orleen lay on a peninsula some ten miles\\r\\nbroad, with water on three sides of the city. The Noths were landing,\\r\\nspreading around the shores; across the land from shore to shore they\\r\\nwere massed, but as yet they had not entered the city. Thousands of\\r\\nArans were there—the king and his royal family—penned like rats in a\\r\\ntrap. And there was only the small cavern with its meager garrison of\\r\\nScientists to defend them.</p>\\r\\n<p>George found himself near the outer edge of the magnetic attraction. He\\r\\ncould see the figures in the air nearer the barge struggling to escape\\r\\nfrom it. He did not know where Loto was, or Azeela or Dee. He saw\\r\\nMogruud, with fifteen or twenty of the Bas about him. They were passing\\r\\nswiftly below.</p>\\r\\n<p>George wondered what he should do. The two larger barges were\\r\\nwithdrawing. Some of the aerial figures were following them, and George\\r\\nstarted moving that way. The figures were attacking the barges from down\\r\\nnear the surface<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_160\">[Pg 160]</a></span> of the water. Mogruud and his men were there now.\\r\\nGeorge hastened.</p>\\r\\n<p>This last attack of the Anglese was one of desperate fury. George could\\r\\nsee the flash of the bolts close to the water. One of the barges must\\r\\nhave fired through its own darkness and struck its mate. As the\\r\\nblackness cleared, George saw that both the Noth vessels were blazing.\\r\\nOne of them sank a moment later; from the flames on the other, figures\\r\\nwere plunging into the water.</p>\\r\\n<p>The Anglese—one of them mounting—cast loose a light-bomb. In the\\r\\nbrilliant glare, the aerial figures were darting about over the surface\\r\\nof the water, seeking out the Noth men and dogs who were swimming toward\\r\\nthe island and striking them with the little thunderbolts, or with\\r\\nspurts of yellow-red flame at closer range. George arrived to join them.\\r\\nIt was ghastly but necessary work. He used his weapons until they were\\r\\nexhausted.</p>\\r\\n<p>The battle was won—all but the giant magnet. In the distance its\\r\\nblood-curdling scream still sounded.</p>\\r\\n<p>And then George saw Dee. She had been several thousand feet up, flying\\r\\nwith another girl, when the magnet was first put into operation. They\\r\\nwere not close enough to feel its pull. A whirling knife had approached\\r\\nthem; struck the other girl, killed her. It was spent, but a corner of\\r\\nit had knocked Dee\\'s motor-cylinder from her hand. She had begun\\r\\nfloating down. Ever since, she had been trying to swim through the air;\\r\\nwith arms and legs kicking, she had fought to sustain herself.</p>\\r\\n<p>She was almost at the surface when George saw her struggling,\\r\\nineffectually, like a swimmer exhausted. He darted to her and gathered\\r\\nher in his arms. His cylinder drew them both upward.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Dee,\" he whispered. \"My little Dee You\\'re safe!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Loto had dropped close to the surface. The magnet was pulling him, but\\r\\nwith his cylinder held against it, he could make headway. By now the\\r\\nmagnet had done most of its work; those in the air had either succumbed\\r\\nor escaped beyond range.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_161\">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>To one side, Loto could see the attack on the other two barges. Fahn\\'s\\r\\nvoice in his ear told him of the landing at Orleen. The Scientist\\r\\nordered them all back. They were needed at Orleen; they must return.</p>\\r\\n<p>But the magnetic barge was heading down the channel. It would be used at\\r\\nOrleen. It must be stopped—<i>destroyed now</i>. Loto disobeyed Fahn. He\\r\\nheaded for the little barge.</p>\\r\\n<p>It was a plunge of no more than a few minutes. Soon Loto was well within\\r\\nthe field of magnetism; he could not withdraw now. He tried to think\\r\\nclearly. Those others of the Anglese who had met this death had lost\\r\\ncontrol of themselves in the air. They had plunged forward, struggling,\\r\\nwhirling so that they had not been able to use their weapons.</p>\\r\\n<p>Loto had no thunderbolts left. His only weapon was the flaming liquid\\r\\ngas which he could project some fifty feet.</p>\\r\\n<p>Just above the surface, head first, like an arrow, he slid forward\\r\\nthrough the air. He did not fight against the magnet; he used his\\r\\ncylinder only to keep himself from turning sidewise.</p>\\r\\n<p>He was conscious of the dark outlines of the barge rushing up at him. He\\r\\nfired his jet of flame; though he did not know it then, he had fired too\\r\\nsoon. The flames fell short. A downward thrust of his cylinder power\\r\\nforced him upward. He barely missed the wire caging as his body shot\\r\\nover it, past it.</p>\\r\\n<p>The magnet\\'s scream was deafening. The Noths on the barge had fired a\\r\\nsmall thunderbolt between the wires, but had missed the swiftly passing\\r\\nmark.</p>\\r\\n<p>Loto\\'s momentum carried him a hundred feet or more beyond the barge. The\\r\\nmagnet stopped him, drew him swiftly back. He was turning over now; he\\r\\nhad lost control of himself. The sea, the sky, the approaching barge\\r\\nwere mingled in whirling confusion. He knew he could never escape; he\\r\\nmust strike the magnet with his flame, this time or never. A moment more\\r\\nand he would be electrocuted against the cage.</p>\\r\\n<p>A tiny bolt cracked past him. He turned over again, righted himself\\r\\nmomentarily, and fired. The electrical scream died<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_162\">[Pg 162]</a></span> into abrupt silence;\\r\\nthe flames had caught the magnet, burned out its coils.</p>\\r\\n<p>Released suddenly, Loto\\'s body shot upward with the pull of his\\r\\ncylinder. The cage, with flames spreading under it, dropped away beneath\\r\\nhim.</p>\\r\\n<p>He righted himself, and at a distance of about three hundred feet, hung\\r\\npoised in the air. The flames spread over the barge; a few Noth figures\\r\\nplunged frantically into the water.</p>\\r\\n<p>Loto mounted upward to join his comrades. Barely seventy-five of the\\r\\noriginal three hundred and twenty-eight, were left. Ten of them were\\r\\ngirls. Loto found Azeela safe. George still carried Dee in his arms.</p>\\r\\n<p>The flames from the burning barges died out; the silent moonlit channel\\r\\nwas strewn with floating bodies. It seemed almost futile to search for\\r\\ntheir wounded, but they descended, and for a time moved about near the\\r\\nsurface. They found two still alive—one burned, the other, a girl,\\r\\nmangled by a flying knife.</p>\\r\\n<p>Silently, with their burdens, they took their way back through the air\\r\\nto the cavern.</p>\\r\\n<p>It was a night of confusion. The Noths were clustered around Orleen,\\r\\nwaiting for the dawn before they entered the city. They were still\\r\\ncoming across the channel on swimming dogs. All night they came. The\\r\\npuny garrison at the Orleen cavern was powerless to stop them. It\\r\\nexhausted its bolts and began sending out calls for help.</p>\\r\\n<p>The Bas around Anglese City were mobilizing with their dogs. Hastily,\\r\\nFahn equipped them with weapons—hand thunderbolts and flame projectors.\\r\\nAn hour-and-a-half before dawn, they were ready to start their almost\\r\\nhopeless attempt to stem the horde of invaders who now held the entire\\r\\nwestern end of the island.</p>\\r\\n<p>The little rag-end of the aerial army that returned from the battle was\\r\\nexhausted, but in a few hours, it too, was ready to start.</p>\\r\\n<p>Fahn, with his two daughters, and Rogers, Loto and<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_163\">[Pg 163]</a></span> George, took the\\r\\nFrazia plane. On its platform Fahn mounted a single projector, the most\\r\\npowerful he possessed.</p>\\r\\n<p>They started an hour before dawn—silent as they gazed down at the\\r\\nisland of palms that was passing beneath them. They overtook their Bas\\r\\narmy and left it behind them. In the air, back over Anglese City, tiny\\r\\nspecks showed that the aerial army was starting. Above the hum of the\\r\\nFrazia motors they hear the aerial voices of Anglese City telling the\\r\\nBas peasants who lived between the two cities to come eastward. They\\r\\nwere obeying; little groups of refugees—old men, women and\\r\\nchildren—were moving along all the roads. In the sky ahead, occasional\\r\\nflashes shot up from Orleen.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"The Arans went there to avoid the deluge,\" Rogers said suddenly, and\\r\\nhis laugh was grim.</p>\\r\\n<p>No one answered him.</p>\\r\\n<p>Behind them the eastern sky was brightening. Loto was piloting the\\r\\nplane, with Rogers beside him. The daylight grew, began reddening.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Look, Father, there\\'s Orleen!\"</p>\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 45%;\">\\r\\n<p>The second largest city on the island, Orleen lay in a hollow, with twin\\r\\npeaks close behind it, the mouth of the channel and the gulf in front\\r\\nand to the sides. It was an Aran city, more beautiful even than the\\r\\ncapital.</p>\\r\\n<p>The plane, flying high, was circling. Loto\\'s gaze went to the dawn. The\\r\\nsun came up a huge, distorted ball of crimson fire, with lines of flame\\r\\nradiating from it to the zenith. A dark mass of rain cloud, hanging low\\r\\nabove Orleen, lost its blackness as it soaked up the crimson light. The\\r\\nsky, even to the western horizon, was steeped in blood; the water\\r\\nreflected it; the air itself seemed to hold it suspended.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"The day of deluge,\" murmured Loto. \"The blood that will be spilled\\r\\ntoday—\"</p>\\r\\n<p>As though in answer to his words, the clouds above Orleen began spilling\\r\\nrain. And as the water fell, it caught<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_164\">[Pg 164]</a></span> the crimson sunlight—myriad\\r\\ndrops of blood falling upon the Aran city.</p>\\r\\n<p>The storm was transitory the rain cloud swept past, but the blood in the\\r\\nsky remained.</p>\\r\\n<p>In the hours that had passed since the plane left Anglese City, the\\r\\nNoths had occupied Orleen. Its cavern was taken. The Noth men and dogs\\r\\nstood in solid ranks around the mountain base; the beaches were black\\r\\nwith them. They were still coming across the channel—riders mounted\\r\\nupon swimming dogs, an occasional barge.</p>\\r\\n<p>There were no sounds of thunderbolts in the city, no flashes. But as the\\r\\nplane descended, human sounds were heard—faint screams. And the city\\r\\nstreets were in confusion.</p>\\r\\n<p>Fahn was staring down into the city through lenses mounted in short\\r\\nblack tubes. He murmured something that his companions did not catch.\\r\\nHis face was white and set; he was struggling to hold his composure.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Descend, Loto. They are not armed with thunderbolts; those are all with\\r\\nToroh and his men in the cavern.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The plane glided down, circling low above the city. The scene of carnage\\r\\nthere became a series of brief, fragmentary pictures. Above the drone of\\r\\nthe Frazia motors, they could hear the snarling of fighting dogs, the\\r\\nscreams of men and women, the shrill treble of children—human screams\\r\\nof agony as the fangs of the brutes tore at them.</p>\\r\\n<p>The plane passed low above a city street, following its length to the\\r\\nblue water that lapped the white sand at its end. The street was full of\\r\\ndogs. A Noth rider—sinister, animal-like, with his black-bound head and\\r\\nhis naked torso covered with black hair—arrived at a silent white\\r\\nhouse, with its white columns, splashing fountain, and vivid trellised\\r\\nflowers. The Noth dismounted, rushed into the house. He came out\\r\\ndragging an Aran woman—flung her white body to the eager, snarling\\r\\nbrute. At the beach, hundreds of terrified Arans sprang into the water;\\r\\nthe dogs followed them, pulled them under, released them at last, and\\r\\nthe surf flung their mangled bodies up on the sand.</p>\\r\\n<p>There was a public square where a hundred or more<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_165\">[Pg 165]</a></span> Arans had gathered.\\r\\nThe dogs charged them, tore at them, flung them into the air—fought\\r\\nover their broken bodies long after life had gone.</p>\\r\\n<p>The dogs spread to every corner of the city. A child climbed a\\r\\npergola—a little Aran boy, white skinned, with long golden curls and a\\r\\nplump baby face. The dogs could not reach him; a Noth man climbed up,\\r\\npulled him down.</p>\\r\\n<p>Loto had given the Frazia controls to his father. With a small\\r\\nthunderbolt globe at his belt he went to the platform outside the cabin.\\r\\nPresently he found Azeela beside him. Her arm was around him; together\\r\\nthey clung to their insecure footing, watching the scenes below as the\\r\\nplane made its swift circle over the city.</p>\\r\\n<p>What could Fahn do? The thunderbolt projector, here on the platform,\\r\\ncould kill a few Noths, a few dogs here and there. But of what avail\\r\\nwould that be among these hordes? The Orleen Cavern? Could they attack\\r\\nthat? Toroh was probably there in the cavern. If they could kill him,\\r\\nthese Noth barbarians, without a leader...</p>\\r\\n<p>Confused and sick from what he was seeing, Loto tried to force Azeela\\r\\ninto the cabin, but the white lipped girl would not go. The plane\\r\\napproached a house where an Aran woman crouched on the roof top with two\\r\\nlittle girls huddled at her feet. A Noth appeared from below, dashed at\\r\\nthem across the roof. Beneath the eaves a dozen dogs stood with bared,\\r\\ndrippings fangs pointed upward.</p>\\r\\n<p>The plane was almost over the house. Loto pointed his globe downward,\\r\\npressed its lever. There was a flash, a miniature crack of thunder and\\r\\nthe globe recoiled in his hand. On the roof top the Noth man and the\\r\\nAran woman and her children lay dead. The woman\\'s white robe was\\r\\nblackened, the children\\'s bodies were burned, shriveled; a cornice of\\r\\nthe building was ripped off and the woodwork was blazing.</p>\\r\\n<p>It was so useless! Loto flung the globe from him, loathing it for having\\r\\nkilled that woman and her little girls. He drew Azeela back with him\\r\\ninto the cabin.</p>\\r\\n<p>The king\\'s palace in Orleen stood near the waterfront,<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_166\">[Pg 166]</a></span> in the midst of\\r\\nbroad, magnificent gardens. A mob of Noths surged around it, into the\\r\\nlower doors, on the balconies and roof top. As the plane passed\\r\\noverhead, its occupants caught a fleeting glimpse of the queen and her\\r\\nchildren, the girl wives of the king and the king himself—in the face\\r\\nof death with petty barriers at last broken down—all huddled together\\r\\nin a corner of the roof. The Noths rushed at them, broad, heavy swords\\r\\nflashing.</p>\\r\\n<p>The plane swept past.</p>\\r\\n<p>The twin peaks of Orleen stood six hundred feet apart, just behind the\\r\\ncity. The one that housed the cavern had a broad, circular base, with a\\r\\nragged, volcanic looking cone above. The other peak was considerably\\r\\nhigher; it looked down upon its fellow.</p>\\r\\n<p>Fahn had directed Rogers to fly the plane to the higher of the peaks.\\r\\nThe Scientist had hardly spoken. He was pale, grim as ever, but his\\r\\ngaze, when he looked upon his daughters held a curious softness. What\\r\\nwere his plans. What were they going to do? George asked the questions,\\r\\nbut Fahn ignored them.</p>\\r\\n<p>The little aerial army approaching from Anglese City was now in sight.\\r\\nFahn radioed them to move back, descend, and stop the Bas army and its\\r\\ndogs. All of them were to return to the capital.</p>\\r\\n<p>The plane landed on a small level rock near the summit of the higher\\r\\npeak. On top of the cavern, six hundred feet away, a solitary male\\r\\nfigure stood. The blood light of the sunrise fell full upon it. <i>Toroh!</i>\\r\\nHe was standing there, regarding the city.</p>\\r\\n<p>Fahn leaped to the projector, but Toroh had disappeared.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Hurry!\" exclaimed the Scientist. He still would not let them question\\r\\nhim. He unlashed the projector and they helped him lower it to the\\r\\nground. He leaped down after it, adjusting it, swinging it to bear down\\r\\nupon the lower peak.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"We must hurry,\" he repeated. He was back on the cabin platform. \"They\\r\\nwill be out of the cavern, firing upon us.\"<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_167\">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>The Noths down there were gazing up at the plane; others were now\\r\\npouring out of the cavern entrance.</p>\\r\\n<p>Fahn\\'s projector was trained on the crater of the lower mountain. From\\r\\nthis greater height its depths were visible.</p>\\r\\n<p>In the cabin of the plane the Scientist\\'s arms went around his\\r\\ndaughters. \"Good-by, my girls—for a little time,\" he whispered in their\\r\\nown tongue.</p>\\r\\n<p>They were frightened; suddenly Dee was crying. But he pushed them from\\r\\nhim. He would attack the cavern; they must all stay in the plane—rise\\r\\nhigh—very high.</p>\\r\\n<p>Something in the man\\'s look, the command in his voice, struck them all\\r\\nsilent. They obeyed. He climbed down to the rock. The plane mounted\\r\\nswiftly into the air.</p>\\r\\n<p>The sun was above the eastern horizon; the sky was an inverted bowl of\\r\\nblood. Beneath the plane Fahn\\'s figure, standing beside his projector,\\r\\nshowed clear-cut against the black rock under him. At the base of the\\r\\ncavern mountain Noths had appeared with apparatus. They were adjusting\\r\\nit hurriedly.</p>\\r\\n<p>A blue-white flash from Fahn\\'s projector spat downward across the six\\r\\nhundred feet and into the crater mouth. Thunder rolled out. Another\\r\\nflash, another—until they became almost continuous. Far down in the\\r\\nearth within the crater, the slumbering forces began to answer. A\\r\\nrumbling sounded—a low, ominous muttering, pregnant with infinite\\r\\npower. Steam hissed upward; a puff of smoke....</p>\\r\\n<p>The plane had been ascending rapidly; it was thousands of feet up now.\\r\\nFahn\\'s thunderbolts persisted, and at last the angered fires of the\\r\\nearth were unleashed. The mountain seemed to split apart; the report was\\r\\ndeafening; flaming gases, cinders and ashes were hurled upward and\\r\\noutward.</p>\\r\\n<p>The main force of the explosion was sidewise toward the city, but even\\r\\nso the plane barely avoided the torrent of molten rock and blazing gas\\r\\nthat mounted from below.</p>\\r\\n<p>The city was engulfed in flames over which a heavy smoke hung like a\\r\\npall. A tremendous lake of viscous liquid fire lay where the peaks and\\r\\nthe cavern once had been.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_168\">[Pg 168]</a></span> The earth was rumbling, shaking, splitting\\r\\napart. The scene was vague—dulled by a lurid red glare that struggled\\r\\nwith the blackness of the smoke.</p>\\r\\n<p>A moment, and a rift appeared. The smoke seemed to part, roll aside.\\r\\nThrough the rift, the burning city showed for an instant clear and\\r\\ndistinct—the crowded city in which no single human or beast could have\\r\\nremained alive.</p>\\r\\n<p>Still not content, the earth was heaving over the whole western end of\\r\\nthe island. And from the sea a great tidal wave came rolling up over the\\r\\nsinking land, hissing, quenching the fires, obscuring everything in a\\r\\ncloud of steam. Like a mist, the steam presently dissipated. The turgid\\r\\nwaters lashed themselves into furious waves that gradually were stilled.</p>\\r\\n<p>And then it was daylight, sullen red day, with only the wreckage on the\\r\\nwaters—charred fragments of bodies, thousands of them floating for\\r\\nmiles around—mute evidence of what had gone before.</p>\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 65%;\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</h2>\\r\\n<p>Once again the plane hung like a shimmering ghost above the towering\\r\\npiles of steel and masonry—New York City at the peak of its\\r\\ncivilization. For Azeela and Dee, it had been a brief trip of awe and\\r\\nwonder; a trip northward through space and back through time.</p>\\r\\n<p>After the cataclysm, they had stayed but a week back in Anglese City.\\r\\nThe entire western end of the island had sunk into the gulf, carrying\\r\\nToroh and his Noths and the Arans and their King to destruction. In\\r\\nAnglese City a new government was formed—a democracy of the Bas, with\\r\\nMogruud at its head.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_169\">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>Rogers was impatient to return to his wife in New York City. Azeela and\\r\\nDee, left orphans, had no wish to stay. Unobtrusively as it had come,\\r\\nthe Frazia plane departed.</p>\\r\\n<p>In the humming, glowing cabin of the plane the voyagers were waiting for\\r\\nthe dials to reach the time world for which they were headed. On one of\\r\\nthe side benches, the ghostlike figures of Loto and Azeela sat a little\\r\\napart from the others; they were talking softly as they gazed down\\r\\nthrough the window beside them.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You think Mogruud will make a good leader?\" she asked. \"My father would\\r\\nhave been so strong, so stern, but always just and fair....\" Her eyes\\r\\nhad filled with tears.</p>\\r\\n<p>He pressed her hand sympathetically. \"I know, Azeela. But you mustn\\'t\\r\\ngrieve. He gave his life for his people.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes. And he said \\'Good-by—for a little time.\\' Oh, Loto—I did not\\r\\nrealize then what he meant.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"He knew—someday—you would be with him again.

Always, as long as we live.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Beloved,\" she murmured. \"Beloved, who always understands.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Rogers had been talking to George and Dee. He left them to attend to the\\r\\nmotors. Dee was watching the scene beneath the plane; as they fled back\\r\\nthrough the centuries the great city was melting away.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Your city that we\\'re going to,\" she said after a long silence. \"George,\\r\\nis it like this? Are we almost to its time now?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"No,\" he laughed. \"It\\'s a very little, puny city I have to show you,\\r\\nDee. I used to think it was wonderful.

I—\"</p>\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 45%;\">\\r\\n<p>On this return journey, the plane had now reached the height of its time\\r\\nvelocity. The swiftly changing form of the city blurred the scene into a\\r\\nconfusion of shifting details, among which only the broadest\\r\\nfundamentals were discernible. The northern section of Central Park\\r\\npresently lay open. Then the great building that covered its southern\\r\\nend melted into nothingness, and trees and water were in its stead.</p>\\r\\n<p>George was at the dials. \"One hundred years! We\\'re almost into our own\\r\\ncentury!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Through decreasing intensities of the proton current, they slackened\\r\\ntheir time velocity. The park, whitened with winter, turned green again\\r\\nas the previous summer was reached. Soon the days separated from the\\r\\nnights. The sun came up from the west, plunged swiftly across the sky,\\r\\nand dropped into the east.</p>\\r\\n<p>It was spring, but the retrogression soon brought winter again. A\\r\\nJanuary snowfall lay white beneath the naked trees of the park. But it\\r\\nwas autumn in a moment.</p>\\r\\n<p>Rogers was watching the dials closely. Summer again; then spring. In one\\r\\nof the brief periods of night he threw the switch to the first\\r\\nintensity. The plane began drifting to the south. The dim stars were\\r\\nswinging eastward in a murky sky. The city lights shone yellow.</p>\\r\\n<p>The roof of the Scientific Club came into view among the buildings south\\r\\nof the plane. Rogers threw off the current completely.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Look, Dee!\" cried George. \"Look, Azeela! There it is at last! See the\\r\\nboard enclosure?\"</p>\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 45%;\">\\r\\n<p>An evening in March. In the large living room of the Banker\\'s Park\\r\\nAvenue apartment, a group of his friends were gathered. Dinner was over;\\r\\na butler was serving coffee and the men were lighting their cigars.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_171\">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>A woman and four men—all in evening dress—were sitting in a group;\\r\\nmingled with their voices came the soft, limpid tones of a piano. It\\r\\nstood in a secluded alcove—a grand piano of carved mahogany. On a bench\\r\\nbefore its keyboard, a young man in a Tuxedo was playing. George. Dee\\r\\nstood beside him, leaning against the instrument. She was gazing first\\r\\nat the page of music with a puzzled frown, then at his fingers as they\\r\\nroamed the keys, and then, in admiration, at his face.</p>\\r\\n<p>On a high-back davenport before an open fireplace, Loto sat with Azeela.\\r\\nThere was an artificial black flower in her spun-gold hair; the mourning\\r\\ncustom of her time world. Her milk-white throat was bare, and the blue\\r\\nof her dress was mirrored in her eyes. She was silent, staring into the\\r\\nflames licking upward from the huge logs.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"That\\'s very pretty music,\" she said finally. \"So big an\\r\\ninstrument—this piano as you call it—you never would think one could\\r\\nplay it.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Chopin,\" he answered. \"A piece by Chopin. George plays Chopin mighty\\r\\nwell. Azeela, there is so much I have to show you. Just that one little\\r\\nthing—Chopin, for instance. I want you to hear the music of some of the\\r\\ngreat composers and pianists.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"And the opera,\" she prompted. \"And you promised you would take me to a\\r\\ntheater.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I will, of course. There are so many things for you to see. Why, it\\r\\nwill be just like a new world, a new life that you\\'re just beginning,\\r\\nAzeela.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes,\" she murmured. \"A new life in a new world. It seems like that\\r\\nalready.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"And wait till you ride in the subways! You\\'ll be surprised how—\"</p>\\r\\n<p>But she shuddered. \"I do not believe I want to do that. It would bring\\r\\nback memory of the cavern...other things.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>George and Dee left the piano and walked over to the fireplace. Azeela\\r\\nmoved over on the davenport. Loto stood up, but George shook his head.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_172\">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>\"Thanks. Dee and I thought we\\'d try the window seat.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Across the room the Big Business Man, the Doctor, and the Banker were\\r\\ndemanding additional details from Rogers.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"That Toroh and his Noths were in the cavern at Orleen\" the Banker said\\r\\ngruffly. \"Can\\'t you keep the thing straight? I want to hear it\\r\\nconsecutively—not jumped around in this way.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Ensconced in the window seat, George and Dee gazed out at the yellow\\r\\nlights of the city around them—a city so different from anything Dee\\r\\ncould have even imagined.</p>\\r\\n<p>There was a soft, rose-shaded light beside the girl. George was not\\r\\nlooking out of the window, but at her. He had seen Dee in many costumes,\\r\\nbut never, he thought, was she so beautiful as right now.</p>\\r\\n<p>A girl of his own time world. He had not realized that this was the way\\r\\nhe had always wanted her to look. Her dress, dropping to a few inches\\r\\nabove her ankles, was soft and clinging. Her black hair, like Azeela\\'s,\\r\\nwas dressed high on her head. Like Azeela, too, she wore the dark\\r\\nmourning flower. The soft light beside her cast a flush on her\\r\\nmilk-white throat and cheeks.</p>\\r\\n<p>Feeling his gaze, she turned.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You like the way Lylda has clothed me? It feels very strange.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes,\" he said. \"You look beautiful, Dee.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>She turned back to the window in confusion. From below, the hum of the\\r\\ncity floated up to them; the raucous sirens of automobiles.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yes,\" he repeated. \"I do like it very much, Dee.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Abruptly his arms were around her; he was kissing her.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"George! Some one will see us!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"No,\" he protested. \"No, they won\\'t. Anyway suppose they do? I don\\'t\\r\\ncare—do you?\"<br><br><br><br></p>\\r\\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"></div><section class=\"pg-boilerplate pgheader\" id=\"pg-footer\" lang=\"en\">\\r\\n<div id=\"pg-end-separator\">\\r\\n<span>*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MAN WHO MASTERED TIME ***</span>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n    \\r\\n<div>\\r\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will\\r\\nbe renamed.\\r\\n</div><div>\\r\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\r\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\r\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\\r\\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\\r\\nroyalties.
